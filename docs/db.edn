Presumably very low dose\ndoesn't do the sensitising effect. It smells like an NADPH oxidase mediated\neffect but no joy hunting on Pubmed...\n#+end_quote\n\nSo maybe there is some sense of insulin sensitization, then too much energy?\n\n** Mechanisms responsible for regulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolism\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.007\n\n- \"In a nutshell, we believe that under certain conditions medium chain\n  triglycerides and PPARɑ ligands can cause inhibition of BDK activity\"\n- \"MCTs are more readily hydrolyzed and the transport of medium chain fatty\n  acids into mitochondria does not require carnitine. MCTs are an effective part\n  of the treatment of patients with mitochondrial fat oxidation disorders [60].\"\n  - like what if I really just have a carnitine issue? Unlikely but possible\n    - can follow up w/ chris masterjohn stuff\n- \"Octanoate [aka C8:0] is a potent inhibitor of BDK [12]\"\n  \"Studies with dogs [61], preterm infants [62], and adults [60] have\n  demonstrated stimulation of leucine oxidation by medium-chain triglycerides.\"\n- \"can interfere with the increase in protein synthesis that normally occurs in\n  response to leucine in the postprandial state.\"\n  - so maybe there's just a \"if you have high protein, eat it in isolation.\"\n    Or get more carnitine so you don't need it\n\nMaybe protein /should/ hit the liver before fat so you get the BCAA anabolic\nspike followed by energy when BCAAs have fallen so you don't get BCAAs gumming\nup fat metabolism.\n\nOr maybe you have too much fat floating around first! bc ur carnitine isn't\nworking. Then the protein hits and brings some carnitine and fucks shit up.\n\n** Sex and genetic background define the metabolic, physiologic, and molecular\n   response to protein restriction\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2021.12.018\n\n- insulin sensitivity was not significantly affected by low protein (LP) diet\n- but glucose homeostasis was improved for everyone\n  - may be bc of β cell function, insulin sensitivity, & less GNG\n- increased ketogenesis! even though high carbs\n\n** SLC7A14 imports GABA to lysosomes and impairs hepatic insulin sensitivity via inhibiting mTORC2\n- SLC7A14 expression increased from high fat diet (HFD)\n- SLC7A14 KO (SLKO) showed improved IR in both HFD & chow diet\n  - specifically hepatic IR it seems\n- SLC7A14 moves ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into lysosomes\n- GABA supplementation makes IR worse in hepatocytes\n- mTORC2 decreased by GABA ester\n  - mTORC2 is inhibited by SLC7A14-imported lysosomal GABA\n  - also, promoting mTORC2 while injecting GABA rescued IR\n    - so this must be primary mechanism\n  - blocking mTORC2 prevented benefits of IR from SLKO\n    - side note: very cool how they're able to block it with a adeno-accociated\n      virus expressing small hairpin RNA specific for RICTOR (+AAV-RICTOR)\n- mTORC2 activiy correlates with insulin sensitivity\n  TODO: why?\n- levels of GABA in hepatocytes _in lysosomes_ caused IR.\n  Liver levels in general were unchanged\n** Review: Protein restriction and branched-chain amino acid restriction promote geroprotective shifts in metabolism\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13626\n\nfrom Lamming lab\n\n- ileu is th worst\n- enzymes\n  - BCAT (branched-chain aminotransferase)\n    - converts ⍺-ketoglutarate + any BCAA to branched-chain keto acid (BCKA)\n    - BCATm isoform is in mitochondria (NOT expressed in liver).\n      - whole-body deletion improves IR, though you need less BCAA to avoid toxicity\n      - iWAT-specific knockout improves metabolism. More thermogenesis.\n    - BCATc is cytoplasm\n      - highly expressed in CNS cells to get glutamate\n    - converts\n      - ileu => ⍺-keto-methylvalerate (KMV)\n      - val => ⍺-ketoisovalerate (KIV)\n      - leu => ⍺-ketoisocaproate (KIC)\n  - BCKDH (branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase)\n    - BCKDK blocks it\n      - BCKDK is also allosterically inhibited by BCKA excess\n      - BT2 is a recently identified allosteric inhibitor of BCKDK, improves IR\n        - increases BCAA oxidation in skeletal muscle\n    - PPM1K or PP2Cm unblocks it\n      - whole-body deletion of ppm1k improves IR!\n- outputs:\n  - ileu => acetyl-CoA + propionyl CoA (=> TCA via succinate they say)\n  - val => propionyl-CoA\n  - leu => acetoacetate + acetyl-CoA\n- all intermediates after BCAT are stuck in mitochondria due to CoA\n- mice genetically predisposed to high endurance catabolize BCAAs faster, and\n  more efficiently; this is likely driven by increased PGC1⍺\n\nI think Lamming is missing the point. They need to fucking drop FGF21. More\nabout the acyl-CoA buildup causing everything to get gummed up.\n\n** Review: Insulin action, type 2 diabetes, and branched-chain amino acids: A two-way street\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101261\n\nPhillip White\n\nmight be better than Lamming.\n\n- \"two of the three studies demonstrated that genetic variants associated with\n  increased BCAA levels are linked with increased risk for development of T2D\"\n  - TODO: check my genetics\n- adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PPM1K leads to similar lowering of BCAA\n  and BCKA as BT2 (discussed above)\n  => liver is important here\n- adipose also comsumes a lot\n- skeletal muscle burns just as much when you're fat\n  - think that \"spill over\" of BCAAs to muscle gums up fat and glucose\n    metabolism there also\n- obese humans may have more BCAA producing bacteria in microbiome\n  - all they need is pyruvate to make it!\n- BCAA restriction improves IR in all mice/rats (fat, skinny)\n- BDK:PPM1k ratio favoring BCADH (i.e. low ratio) improves IR. ie BT2 et al.\n  - Me: Opposite from Lamming. Must be tissue specific. Maybe this is preventing spillover. Opposite would be preventing harm in peripheral tissues.\n    => want to break down BCAAs in liver (and adipose?), not in muscle.\n  - ALSO ZFR BT2 studies: \"reduced phosphorylation of Ser454 in a peptide from the ACLY protein in the livers of ZFR\". \"ACLY catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to form acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate in the cytoplasm, with the former contributing to the formation of malonyl CoA, which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) to slow fatty acid oxidation, but also serving as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis.\"\n    - i.e. lower BDK:PPM1K => less ACLY => don't store fat? (in liver at least)\n    - BUT I would expect this would allow liver ability to burn BCAAs short term\n- Leu supplementation actually DECREASES all circulating BCAAs [1]\n- (in bcaa breakdown diagram) \"CoA-modified metabolites generated by BCKDH are readily converted to carnitine-modified metabolites that serve as convenient biomarkers of BCAA catabolism (e.g. C5-AC and C3-AC)\"\n  - wtf? how is carnitine involved?\n- ChREBP-β seems involved in decreasing liver BDK\n  - there's a binding element in the enhancer for BDK gene in primates & rats, but not in mice. ChREBP is important with lipid stuff, so there may be mixed results when looking at mice\n    - STUDY in mice said increasing BCAAs actually improved shit on high fat diet. NOT so in rats.\n- muscle acyl CoA levels are lowered, and urine acyl-glycine adducts are\n  increased in response to feeding of BCAA restricted diets to ZFR\n- \"Consistent with the idea that elevated BCAA exert a “pull” on glycine levels to replenish pyruvate for use in the alanine transaminase reaction, treatment with a specific BCAT inhibitor restores muscle and plasma glycine levels in ZFR\"\n- BCAAs lower central tryptophan levels => hyperphagia. Supplementation fixes it.\n- SLC25A44 seems to transport BCAAs into mitochondria\n- BAT seems important for metabolising BCAAs\n\n- could my [[id:85426d8d-6753-493b-a808-600db97fa455][MTHFR]] issue be creating more demand for glycine making BCAAs worse for me?\n\n** Branched-chain amino acid restriction in Zucker-fatty rats improves muscle insulin sensitivity by enhancing efficiency of fatty acid oxidation and acyl-glycine export\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2016.04.006\n\nfrom [[id:31fde7cb-45ac-4656-8eb5-67b0406794e0][fire in a bottle]]\n\nGREAT theories in here. acetyl-CoA buildup gums up the TCA cycle, causing buildup of acyl-CoA (fatty acid)\n\nThere should be ROS to block buildup, but there's not.\n\nLinks to below study.\n\nSlows\n\n*** protons\nileu\n- 3 NADH\n- 1 FADH2\n- 1 acytl CoA -> 3 NADH 1 FADH2\n- 1 propionyl CoA -> 1 NADH 1 FADH2\n\n  7 NAD : 3 FADH2\n\n** Cross-talk between branched-chain amino acids and hepatic mitochondria is compromised in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nhttps://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00161.2015\n\nsunny et al.\nabove study links to this\nin hepatocytes:\n\nnormal mice: BCAAs cause GNG up, anaplerosis up, pyruvate cycling up, TCA cycle flux down\nNAFLD mice: no change in anything.\n\nSo control mice get hepatic insulin resistance, NAFLD mice do not.

Knowing it's in your head\n  makes me much more open to feel the pain. Going on a run seems less daunting\n  now. Knowing the nobility of the cause helps. The suffering is not pointless.\n  Probably the most meaningful thing you can do in any given moment is face the\n  pain and experience it fully.\"\n\nwhat I missed:\n- thesis that intelligence comes at a more fundamental habitual thought pattern.\n  It's not like people think where you can just force yourself to do certein\n  habits and you'll get smart. It's a pattern on a moment-by-moment basis where\n  you relate to the world differently.\n  - This holds for other things too. e.g. Sam Altman suggesting that making\n    lists is great in his productivity thing. That won't help. It's a result of\n    his lower level thought pattern of holding himself accountable to his past\n    self.\n\n- I notice that ignorant people are always making their situation out to be\n  worse than it is.\n\n- is this holding yourself accountable really the key to it?\n  - no, that's just one thing. Maybe unrelated to intelligence, but definitely\n    important for success.\n\nMaybe the title should be \"at a lower level than you think\".\n\n\nWhere do you think intelligence comes from? What makes someone intelligent?\n- grok hard ideas and draw further implications\n- generate new interesting ideas\n- some aspect of rational aptitude, but many have this. Really intelligent\n  people can draw in more factors and incorperate aspects of the situation that\n  others haven't thought of.\n\nIf you think of how you think moment to moment\n\n** mid november\n\nI've long thought that intelligence may not be the cause of genetics or\ndiligent study, but more a result of lack of ignorance. In a positive\nway, maybe this is curiosity? Or fastidiousness to truth? Or something else?\n\nSome force must drive someone to understand the world accurately.\n\nBut what even is intelligence?\n\nAbility to see different sides of a situation?\nTo see what others don't see?\nPull apart assumptions and see broader context?\nMake connections to seemingly unrelated things?\nCreativity and open-mindedness?\n\nOne must be willing to feel pain to see truth. If a fact is painful, you can\nshield yourself from it. If believing something is pleasurable, you can make\nyourself believe it. The unconscious force of increasing pleasure must be\ncounterbalanced by something else.\n\nThese forces vary depending on the topic at hand and the power balance\ndetermines how likely the viewpoint adopted is truthful.\n\nNot only that, but it determines the will to pursue truth.\n\nThe ability for someone to see truth in a given moment is dependent on the\nstrength of these forces in that moment. It's sometimes surprising to see how\nintelligent some people can be in some areas while being totally dysfunctional\nin others.\n\nHow does one decrease ignorance?\n- Decrease pain/pleasure forces\n  - Don't tie ideas to your identity\n  - Increase pain tolerance. Learn the feeling and learn to love it.\n  - Accept the pain to make it sting less. Walk right into it. This might be\n    what meditation does. Or detach yoursel from it. See [[id:99e82a29-42ac-47fb-9396-e738b314707a][opening awareness]]\n  - Turn the pain into curiosity.\n  - Feel good! This is how MDMA works. But most people are in a low degree of\n    pain simply bc they are unhealthy and don't realize it.\n- Increase pro-truth forces\n  - stay fastidious to truth? tie that to your identity, but not one specific\n    truth\n  - Be curious?\n\nHow does ignorance come about?\n\nRight now I'm just assuming it's there, but most people don't really see this\nhappening in themself, including me. It doesn't feel tangible.\n\nExample:\nSometimes you get pulled into something--a youtube video, social media, some\nthought story--and you come out a few seconds or minutes later.\nYou literally didn't exist for some period of time. In this way, you can\ndistract yourself from the pain of existence.\n\nIt's so easy to say that this isn't you. You sometimes see someone who can't get\ntheir life together because of how obviously ignorant they are. Usually because\nthey willfully ignore some aspect of themselves that is causing this pattern and\nthey are unwilling to change. If only they looked deeply at what was actually\nhappening then it'd be quite easy for them to accept it and change. But they\ndon't look at that bc it's painful. Or they're afraid of it. They could be\npowerless to do anything about it so why face that?\n\n\nBut you don't see that ignorance is probably a gradient. It's always there, just\na matter of degree. How much can you take? How much pain can you take?\n\nEven writing about this and flushing through the actual process makes it less\ndaunting. It's the knowing that nothing is too much. It's mainly that fear which\ncauses the ignorance. Knowing it's in your head makes me much more open to\nfeel the pain. Going on a run seems less daunting now.\nKnowing the nobility of the cause helps.

The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.\n\nIn practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.\n...\nThe way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine.\n...\nDevelop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\" mean something other people tell you to do.\n...\nWhat should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge... But always preserve excitingness.\n\nThere's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.\n\nWhat are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.\n\nOnce you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.\n\nThe next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.\n\nBoldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.\n#+end_quote\n\nI think I'm good at noticing gaps people take for granted. The outlier idea for me right now is [[id:a46ace4f-7454-4ad2-9715-12d4aef9208d][Data Augmentation]] in open source models. But the field isn't wholly ignored.\n\n#+begin_quote\nThe three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.\n#+end_quote\n\nI guess \"desire to do something impressive\" is what PG means when he talks about ambition.\n\n#+begin_quote\nLet's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them...\n[4] There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be\n...\nThe nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.\n\nThe educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like.\n...\nWhat should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.\n...\nWhen in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them... But a field should become /increasingly/ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.\n\nThe stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive...\n\nOne sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.\n...\n...so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.\n...\n#+end_quote\n\nThis is especially relevant for me\n\n#+begin_quote\nThere are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.\n#+end_quote\n\n#+begin_quote\nFollowing your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.\n\nBut while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.\n...\nI think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.\n...\n\nEven when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.\n\nYou don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.\n...\nTo the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.\n\nIt will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.\n...\nWhen I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying \"I'll just read over what I've got so far.\" Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.\n...\nTry to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.\n\nAnother permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all. [7] -- This idea I learned from Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology, which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.\n#+end_quote\n  I need to read Mathematician's Apology (again, but it's been years) [[id:e0a2feb5-6c53-426a-b5a1-4323df1588c3][todo]]\n\n#+begin_quote\nSince there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.\n...\nThe way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older. [9] You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.\n...\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.\n\nThere may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in.\n\n...That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.\n...\nIf you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon\n\n...If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.\n...\nEveryone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)\n\n\nConsciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.\n\nAnd that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good.\n\nOne way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.\n#+end_quote\n\nwrt AI stuff I don't think I'm aiming high enough.

Trying to is affectation.\n...\nThe core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?\n\nOne way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.\n\nAnother more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.\n#+end_quote\n\nI like this. so many people do this and people think they're hot shit:\n\n#+begin_quote\nNerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work.

When\n  there's not enough NAD+, these shorter, half-burnt fats, get filled up and\n  re-attached to carnitine and transferred back out of the mitochondria.\n- beta oxidation feeds into acetyl-CoA, competing with all other fuels.\n- mitochondrial enzymes become acetylated and turned off. acetyl-CoA increases this\n- Sirtuin enzymes – deacetylases that take acetyl groups off of enzymes – are\n  dependent on NAD+\n\n** The Mitochondrial Bottleneck as the carburetor screw; How seed oils cause reductive stress, part II\n- superoxide is ultimately converted into NAD+ with Glutathione\n- superoxide gets generated when complex I AND complex II are running hot.\n- complex II only runs hot with FADH2 poppin off\n\n** , Part III\n- acytlation turns on lipogenic enzymes\n- isocaloric experiments w/ rats and pigs show more saturation => less fattening\n- (my addition) feeding ad libidum (aka how we acutally eat) would make this\n  difference much bigger\n\n** Carbon Recycling: What Happens to Seed Oils When You Eat Them?..., Part IV\n- PUFA's are preferrentially oxidized. Then they're rebuilt as mono and\n  saturated fats for storage.\n- some (~18% in that study) was accumulated, mostly in visceral fat\n** Part V\n- taking sunflower oil instead of cream causes you not to burn glucose when you\n  exercise. i.e. lose metabolic flexibility\n** Part VI\n" 536870913] [23 :nodes/created-time "20220908220649" 536870913] [23 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [23 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220908220649-fire_in_a_bottle.org" 536870913] [23 :nodes/id "31fde7cb-45ac-4656-8eb5-67b0406794e0" 536870913] [23 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [23 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [23 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [23 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [23 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220908220649-fire_in_a_bottle", "ROAM_ALIASES" "\"brad marshall\"", "ID" "31fde7cb-45ac-4656-8eb5-67b0406794e0", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220908220649-fire_in_a_bottle.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [23 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [23 :nodes/title "fire in a bottle" 536870913] [23 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [23 :nodes/value 3.5833333134651184 536870913] [24 :links/dest "\"//github.com/tonsky/datascript\"" 536870913] [24 :links/pos 642 536870913] [24 :links/properties "(:outline (\"relation to datalog\"))" 536870913] [24 :links/source "\"9dc99445-2536-4cf2-ac19-6b3b22a590ea\"" 536870913] [24 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [24 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       9dc99445-2536-4cf2-ac19-6b3b22a590ea\n:END:\n#+title: clara rules\n\n[[id:c7f85840-11a5-4b2c-b574-0c8a028f6a7e][clojure]]\n\na rules engine in clojure\n\n** relation to datalog\n- obviously very similar to [[id:e7ec209c-0d5a-4d23-95e2-c0e12fec4eda][datalog]] in the queries, specifically [[http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/expressions/][facts]]\n- but maybe it's more like [[https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules][odoyle rules]] because there's no \"fact type\"'s in\n  datalog\n  - also more like odoyle bc rules are queries\n- but I think you could build a rules engine based on datalog fairly easily.\n  or, I guess you'd use like [[https://github.com/tonsky/datascript][datascript]] as an in-memory fact database\n" 536870913] [24 :nodes/created-time "20210507144450" 536870913] [24 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [24 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210507144450-clara_rules.org" 536870913] [24 :nodes/id "9dc99445-2536-4cf2-ac19-6b3b22a590ea" 536870913] [24 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [24 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [24 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [24 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [24 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20210507144450-clara_rules", "ID" "9dc99445-2536-4cf2-ac19-6b3b22a590ea", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210507144450-clara_rules.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [24 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [24 :nodes/title "clara rules" 536870913] [24 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [24 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [25 :links/dest "\"//blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful\"" 536870913] [25 :links/pos 344 536870913] [25 :links/properties "(:outline (\"how to be successful\"))" 536870913] [25 :links/source "\"c8f29f62-436a-43e8-a4ef-b0eee15ab5b3\"" 536870913] [25 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [25 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       c8f29f62-436a-43e8-a4ef-b0eee15ab5b3\n:ROAM_ALIASES: sama\n:END:\n#+title: sam altman\n\n[[id:03f07731-cc68-432c-9d16-9c2944f6a21c][yc]] [[id:593d017c-1756-4583-9856-077289ca2ea4][ai optimism]] [[id:d295f68e-a5d2-4081-90c5-e6aa1eb47b11][blogs]]\n\nhttps://blog.samaltman.com/ai\n\nThis blog is so good.\n\n** how to be successful\nhttps://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful\n\n\"In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly\nrewards those who do.\"\n\n** productivity\nfiguring out what to work on is much more important than optimizing\nproductivity.

Your writing becomes an input to you rather than\nbefore your own head.\n\nWords are important! Pick good words that have good meaning.\n- use dictionaries! or thesorus\n\nSay something big in small space. Succinctness is good.\n\n- Add a glossary!\n  - don't be lax about letting words mean two different things\n\n- ask questions!\n  - make clear you're looking for something.

This mapping has trainable parameters.\n- positional encoding\n  - represent distance somehow. They add these to the embeddings.\n  - this is the same number used for all embedded sequence elements.\n    - I believe this mapping is learned somehow. but note gradient will be different from attention stuff bc it is shared across all elements of the sequence.\n- self- attention\n  - softmax(Q*K^T / sqrt(d)) * V\n  - softmax is such that all rows sum to 1.\n    - softmax produces an nxn matrix\n  - multiply by V => nxd matrix\n  - V is nxd\n  - properties\n    - position invariant. i.e. changing positions of sequence doesn't change anything. I guess this why positional encoding is needed?\n    - allows easy masking by setting elements to zero\n- multi-head attention\n  - involves splitting the input Q, K, & V into separate \"heads\" of dimension n x (d/h)\n- training\n  - Example: you want to convert \"<SOS> I love you very much <EOS>\" to \"<SOS>ti amo molto<EOS>\"\n    - <SOS> and <EOS> are special tokens for start of sentence and end of sentence.\n  - feed \"<SOS> I love you very much <EOS>\" into the encoder\n  - feed \"<SOS> ti amo molto\" into the decoder\n  - expect output of \"<SOS> ti amo molto <EOS>\" and then backprop\n- inference\n  - feed \"<SOS> I love you very much <EOS>\" to encoder and just \"<SOS>\" to the decoder\n  - this spits out just the next token.\n  - Then you feed the output back into the decoder and do it again until you see the <EOS> token\n  - sometimes you don't just take the top token output, but you can also do _Beam Search_ where you take the top N values at each step and run with those and recur, but throw away the least probable sequences as you go.\n** Textbooks Are All You Need (Gunasekar)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       115d5936-dcca-489c-afe3-0f843b3481b0\n:SUBNODE_OF: 312af36b-506b-4914-bf21-902ae56d71c3\n:END:\n\n[[id:7aac1502-aa69-499a-a52d-2959813c5b0e][ai papers TODO]]\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644\n\n** microsoft phi-2 blog post\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       c7d53411-bd15-4dec-9750-fee92d5d3040\n:SUBNODE_OF: 312af36b-506b-4914-bf21-902ae56d71c3\n:END:\n\n\nit just a [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/][blog post]] I guess\n\nfrom twitter\n- https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2\n- https://x.com/sytelus/status/1734881560271454525?s=20\n\n- breaking LLM scaling laws\n  - training data quality is huge.

Also uses Rotary positional encodings which is different (and relative as opposed to absolute).\n    - Relative vs absolute\n      - Absolute means that each token gets the same thing added to it based on it's position in the sequence.\n      - Relative means that while calculating attention, the distance between the K and Q is used to calculate the positiional encoding.\n        =e_ij = x_i dot (x_j + a_ij) / sqrt(d)=\n        where a_ij is a vector is the positional encoding vector based on i & j\n        - really, a_ij, is just a function of (i - j)\n        - *Rotary embeddings*\n          - =a_mn = e^i((m - n) * θ)=\n            which is the unit vector rotated by theta\n\n    - Transformer encodings are fixed (not trainable) and absolute,\n    - Llama uses R\n  - FNN uses SwiGLU activation, Transformer uses Relu\n  - KV-cache during self-attention\n    - only used during inference time, so as to not re-compute dot products for previously calculated tokens. This is bc inference is a loop where the output is fed back in to keep generating subsequent tokens.\n  - uses GQA (I think this just Llama 2)\n  - dimention /d/ of embedding was 512 in Transformer, but 4096 for smallest Llama, but goes up to 8192 for largest.\n    - embedding vectors are also learnable by the model (I think same w/ Transformer)\n- *Grouped multi-query attention (GQA)*\n  - GPU bottleneck is memory, not computation by a factor of ~40\n  - Noam Shazeer - \"Fast Transformer Decoding: One Write-Head is All You Need\"\n    - memory access in transformer is actually pretty small compared to number of computations\n    - BUT when using KV-cache, memory access is the bottleneck\n    - If you do different multi-head attention where you only split the query, but keep the same K & V, you can reduce the memory bottleneck at only slight perf degredation.\n      This is just _multi-query_ attention, not grouped.\n  - _grouped_ is like where you still have multiple heads for the keys, you just have less of them.

It seems likely to me that any digitized modality is subject to generative modeling using this framework.\n#+end_quote\n\n" 536870913] [44 :nodes/created-time "20231217202058" 536870913] [44 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [44 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org" 536870913] [44 :nodes/id "312af36b-506b-4914-bf21-902ae56d71c3" 536870913] [44 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [44 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [44 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [44 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [44 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20231217202058-ai_papers", "ID" "312af36b-506b-4914-bf21-902ae56d71c3", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [44 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [44 :nodes/title "ai papers" 536870913] [44 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [44 :nodes/value 3.0160331428050995 536870913] [45 :links/dest "\"//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\"" 536870913] [45 :links/pos 2822 536870913] [45 :links/properties "(:outline (\"inheritance and prototypes\"))" 536870913] [45 :links/source "\"21cb5455-19d1-4516-80ce-dad565cb80c6\"" 536870913] [45 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [45 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       21cb5455-19d1-4516-80ce-dad565cb80c6\n:END:\n#+title: mozilla javascript guide\n\n[[id:81a17d27-594a-4f01-9ec9-7686271bcf24][coding]]\n\n- see file:///Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/projects/learn-javascript\n\n** emacs notes\n- I should get [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]\n- with tsserver\n- use skewer mode. already in doom.\n\n** intro\njs reference is there, kind of on the same page\n\n\"a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language\"\n\n\"In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,\nJavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types\nrepresenting numeric, Boolean, and string values.\"\n\n\"The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is\ninherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions\nwithout any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of\nobjects, executing as loosely typed methods.\"\n\n\"Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require\ntightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming\nmore complex than JavaScript programming.\"\n** Grammar & types\ninstructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons\n\nA _*semicolon is not necessary*_ after a statement if it is written on its own line.\nBut if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated\nby semicolons.\n- It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a\n  statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the\n  chances of bugs getting into the code.\n- ^seems like bullshit?\n\n=var= can be used to declare both local and global variables.\n  - in a function, it's scoped to the function (NOT just the block)\n  - not in a function, it's global\n\n=let & const= are for local, block-scoped variables\n\nlots of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment][destructuring assignment]] forms\n\nvars are _hoisted_, but let/const are not\n\n- undefined\n  - NaN when used in numberical context\n  - falsey\n** functions\n- if a fn assigns a new value to a parameter, this does not change the calling scope\n\n- if a fn /modifies/ the parameter's properties, this is global.\n** iteration\n- iterable protocol\n  - to conform, an object must implement the @@iterator method\n  - when object iterated, this method is called w/ no arguments\n    - it must return something implementing the *iterator* protocol\n  - can *be a generator* fn. so each entity can be provided using =yield=\n- iterator protocol\n  - implements `next()` taking zero or one arguments and returns an =IteratorResult=\n    - IteratorResult\n      - done: true when iteration is over\n      - value: the value returns.

In Lisp, developing software is like speaking face-to-face. You can test code as you’re writing it. And instant turnaround has just as dramatic an effect on development as it does on conversation. You don’t just write the same program faster; you write a different kind of program.\n...\nIn Lisp, as in any language, development is a cycle of writing and testing.

should actually just run these locally instead..\n\nWhat project could I do today?\n- I think I could solve an ocr problem and put it on my blog as a sample?\n\n* practical deep learning for coders\n** chapter 1\n*** lecture\n- bird/nonbird is really easy compared to 2015\n- google ai blog\n  - basic word problems, explaining jokes\n- radek osmulski\n  - wrote a book about learning deep learning and getting a job and stuff!\n- kaggle does ML competitions! and this guy was #1\n- he invented the ULMFiT alg - which was core for the NLP revolution\n- at tesla and openai they make ppl do this course\n\n- why able to do this so fast?\n  - in 2012, they manually engineered features which takes a shit ton of effor\n    and engineering time and math and phD's wasting time\n  - deep learning doesn't require this! neural nets do this automatically\n\n- you don't need intense hardware!!\n  - myth that we need lots of data is companies trying to sell it\n  - this is bc of transfer learning\n\n- we are using pyTorch, tensorflow is dying\n- fastai is a lib built on top of pytorch\n\n- kaggle\n  - his is jhoward, jupyter notebook 101\n\n- DataBlock is important. All the best algs are already known and you don't\n  spend time tweaking them in practice. Mostly you just need to get the data\n  into your model to train\n  - inputs\n    - blocks = types of inputs\n    - get_items = fn to return your training sets\n    - splitter = how you get your training set\n    - get_y = how to get the label.\n    - item_tfms = how to transform each object. i.e. resize\n  - at the end you get a data loaders object, which pytorch uses to pull sample data to\n    train the model with\n  - docs.fast.ai is how you get api info\n  - can also use DataLoaders, which is an even simpler way to create this\n\n- learner\n  - something that combines a model and the data used to train it with.\n    pass in a model and a data loader object\n  - can use a standard model, or you can use timm!\n    - which is a pytorch library of a bunch of different models!\n  - by default, fastai downloads pre-trained weights for you\n    - ie someone else has already trained the model and made the parameters\n      available on the internet.\n- fine_tune\n  - takes original dataset and your dataset, and just finds the differences and\n    tunes the parameters in just that special way.\n*** book\n#+begin_quote\nTrying to spend too much time on the theory can be counterproductive. The key is\nto just code and try to solve problems: the theory can come later, when you have\ncontext and motivation.\n#+end_quote\n\n- the fastai =cnn_learner= will remove the last layer of the model and replace it\n  with one or more layers w/ random weights.\n  - the _head_ is this last added part\n\n- _transfer learning_ is greatly underrated, but is awesome\n  _fine-tuning_ is the process of adapting a pretrained model\n  - it will change the later layers (esp. the /head/) faster\n- _epoch_ is one pass through the training set\n\n#+begin_quote\ndataset contains over 20 million sentence pairs in French and English. He built\nthe dataset in a really clever way: by crawling millions of Canadian web pages\n(which are often multilingual) and then using a set of simple heuristics to\ntransform URLs of French content onto URLs pointing to the same content in\nEnglish.\n#+end_quote\n\nCreating datasets in creative ways is important. keep this in the back of your\nhead.\n\n- by exploring hyperparameters, and measuring their effectiveness against a\n  validation set, we can inadvertantly be over-fitting!\n  - thus, we have a _test set_ to only use at the very very end to see how well\n    we did\n** chapter 2\n*** video\n- formums.fast.ai\n  - every lesson has additional information\n  - tanishq abraham -- has awesome blog post about deploying models\n- jupyter notebook extensions\n  - table of contents (2) - give a nice navigation bar\n  - collapsable headings - collapse and navigate to top\n  - nbdev - install with mamba\n\n\n- more epochs, you might want to augment images in the transformer\n\n- train model /before/ cleaning data!\n  - this can help you find problematic images by using fastai's\n    ImageClassifierCleaner\n\n- huggingface.co -\n  - uses gradio sdk. then make a git repo, then you push it to the repo (which\n    is hosted on huggingface), and then you have an app!\n    - which is actually really cool!\n    - on the forum, he has some examples\n      =learn.export= gives you a file. in kaggle, you can save this file, and\n      then go to the data tab, and find that file.\n      - in colab, you can do the same thing and download from their file browser\n      Then you just take this model, and save it to your github.\n      - can just call =load_learner=\n  - gradio has some cool input mechanisms, gr.Interface\n    - then you can run it locally and see!\n    - they have a lot of widgets and stuff. streamlit.io has a cool thing too.\n    - gradio acutally publishes an API!!!\n      - so you can just talk to it with javascript\n\n  - =#|export= at the top of cells marks them for export. then you run:\n    #+begin_src python\n    import nbdev.export from notebook2script\n    notebook2script.export('app.py')\n    #+end_src\n    and it will write a file, app.py with the concattenation of those cells!\n\n- =?fn_name= in notebook shows short docs of thing =??fn_name= shows extended docs\n\n- you can do most stuff on your own computer, but when you need a gpu, just go to\n  kaggle or colab\n  - fastai/fastsetup github repo - this sets up everything\n    - use conda / your own dev python! DONT use the system python!\n      don't wanna fuck with that.\n\n- use mamba instead of pip bc it will work on your gpu better!\n\n*** book\n- look at books website for newest methods on getting new datasets\n\n- resizing\n  - cutting, squishing, and filling are less than ideal due to throwing out\n    features, unrealistic input, and wasted computation\n  - in practice they re-frame some subset of the image. often taking a different\n    subsection each time.\n- data augmentation\n  - like in images we rotate, flip, crop, warp, change contrast/brightness to\n    make the model more flexible\n** episode 3 / chapter 4\n- gradient / paperspace is awesome and give you a legit computer\n- matrix mult is unintuitive\n  - remind yourself that it's just multiplication and addition.\n    then you have to transpose the weights for each row\n- should try the titanic competition!\n\n- numpy doesn't use GPU or calculating gradients\n\n- _mini-batch_ is the group of items we calculate the loss over before doing an\n  optimization step\n  - batches are good bc they optimize by being able to put a lot into the GPU\n    all at once. But too much can overload the gpu memory\n  - a =DataLoader= can automatically split stuff into batches\n    - you give a DL a =DataSet= which is a collection of tuples containing\n      the independent and dependent variables\n\n- torch.sigmoid() calculates the sigmoid. e.g. =my_tensor.sigmoid()=\n\n- PyTorch gradients\n  - you call .requires_grad_() on a tensor to mark it for calculation.\n    Then every time you perform an operation on it, it remembers the current\n    gradient.\n    - so youd do e.g.\n      #+begin_src python\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n    predictions = predictions.sigmoid()\n    return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\nweights = init_params((28*28,1))\nbias = init_params(1)\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nbatch_size = 4\nbatch = train_x[:batch_size]\npreds = batch@weights + bias\nloss = mnist_loss(preds, train_y[:batch_size])\nloss.backward() # and THIS calculates the grad for weights and bias, which will show up below as:\nweights.grad, bias.grad\n      #+end_src\n      NOTE: calling =backward()= actually /adds/ the gradients of loss to\n      existing gradients, so you should call =weights.grad.zero_()=\n\n  - to NOT include something in the gradient you must do\n     =with torch.no_grad(): <expr>=\n\n#+begin_src python\ndef train_epoch(model, lr, params):\n    for xb,yb in dl:\n        calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n        for p in params:\n            p.data -= p.grad*lr\n            p.grad.zero_()\n#+end_src\n\n- PyTorch modules\n  - a class inheriting from =nn.Module=\n  - contains basically the parameters for some basic models. e.g. nn.Linear\n  - can combine them! e.g. =nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(28*28,30), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(30,1))=\n- Optimizer (might be a fastai thing?)\n  - takes in model params, and learning rate\n  - defines =step()= and =zero_grad()=\n  - fastai provides the SGD optimizer\n- Learner. combines everything and runs it\n  #+begin_src python\nLearner(dls, nn.Linear(28*28,1), opt_func=SGD, loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\n  #+end_src\n** lesson 4 (NLP)\n- will be using transformers i.e. from [[id:d751c891-f4e9-4687-a2d5-800dbec5da9b][attention is all you need]] but the book uses recurrent neural networks\n- watch lesson 0! from the previous section\n\n- likes paperspace!\n\n- huggingface transformers library\n\n- 4 key libs: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, pytorch\n  - book by authors of pandas called \"python for data analysis 3E\"\n  - the fastai book and this will give basically everything you need to make\n    something totally fucking awesome\n  - it's good to know the basics\n\n- hugging face model hub is dope\n  deberta-v3-small\n\n** book chapter 10\n- language models guess the next word in a sequence. you don't need training\n  data, just to give it lots of text. so it's _self-supervised_ learning in this\n  sense.\n- BUT you don't usually directly use these. You use them as pre-trained models for something else bc they come to understand lots about language in their many weights\n" 536870913] [71 :nodes/created-time "20220823150816" 536870913] [71 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [71 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220823150816-fast_ai_practical_deep_learning.org" 536870913] [71 :nodes/id "b23d40cd-e712-427e-b393-fc2e462d1731" 536870913] [71 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [71 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [71 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [71 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [71 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220823150816-fast_ai_practical_deep_learning", "ROAM_ALIASES" "fastai", "ID" "b23d40cd-e712-427e-b393-fc2e462d1731", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220823150816-fast_ai_practical_deep_learning.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [71 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [71 :nodes/title "fast ai practical deep learning" 536870913] [71 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [71 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [72 :links/dest "\"//doi.org/10.3390/antiox10060967\"" 536870913] [72 :links/pos 349 536870913] [72 :links/properties "(:outline (\"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): Impacts on Human Health\"))" 536870913] [72 :links/source "\"0b0345c1-6f87-4204-803c-21c4b8049b89\"" 536870913] [72 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [72 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       0b0345c1-6f87-4204-803c-21c4b8049b89\n:END:\n#+title: nac\n\n[[id:f08e30aa-e83b-451f-88b7-fe954bab2f6e][supplements]]\n\n** TODO: Perspective: Prospects for Nutraceutical Support of Intestinal Barrier Function\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa139\n\nlot of good theory here\n\n** N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): Impacts on Human Health\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10060967\n\n- used as treatment for tylenol overdose?\n\n- 4.7.

However, recent studies with the oral administration of a single AGE-rich meal to human beings as well as labeled single protein-AGEs or diets enriched with specific AGEs such as MG to mice clearly show that dAGEs are absorbed and contribute significantly to the body’s AGE pool (14–16).\n#+end_quote\n\nIf you look at 14-16,\n- 14, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC21074/, they feed humans eggs\n  cooked with or without fructose and observe various things.

introspective memoir feel. I compared his description of travel to\nmy own experiences in Asia and China. It made me want to be more observant and\ntake notes. There's value in taking notes and/or reflecting on the most mundane\nof things.\n\nHis close observation of many things made me want to meditate too. I thought\nmaybe it'd be useful to keep my own travel memoir / notes when I do travel. At\nleast makes me wonder if there'd be any value to it. Even having one of just\neveryday life could potentially give much more self awareness.\n\nChina was a brutal place in the 1970's Cultural Revolution times. They seem like they\nhave a very tight control on their history and free speech. VAST majority of people\ndon't care and actively participate / buy into the CCP rallies. He does not see\nany potential opening or pressure by the people for the CCP to be less\nauthoritarian. There is no criticism allowed whatsoever. And the kids realize when\nPeter inadvertantly insults china (e.g. mentions that people in the west thought\nchina was weak bc their armies were easily defeated), and the kids put their heads\ndown and don't say a word out of embarassment and fear.\n\nThe kids are very used to rote memorization and always seek to immitate rather\nthan to learn and be actually creative. They work extremely hard. Most are from\npeasant families in the countryside and are extremely poor. They don't have ANY\nmechanized agriculture!! They use plows and oxen/horses still!\n\nChina in 1996 reminds me of America in 1920. Their level of industrialization is\nextremely low.\n\nOverall, I liked the book and feel like I learned a lot about Chinese culture.\n" 536870913] [104 :nodes/created-time "20221117122504" 536870913]

Also the newest groundbreaking thing in the space seems to be atlas. Maybe x.com's GROK uses RAG under the hood secretly? And thats how it's able to give up-to-date info?\n\n- what if you used an algorithmically generated dataset like with [[id:5f769d68-123d-44f8-924c-c94fcee687ae][Grokking]], then you could have a smallish database & you could jointly fine-tune model and embedding so you could easily re-compute the database?!\n\n- google has a Natural Questions [[https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/leaderboard][leaderboard]].

People shouldn't be rushing to make a chat interface out of their product like they are. It should just make the product better. AI is great at processing unstructured data and should be used as a tool for that. For him, it's about collecting contextual info.\n- app: research tool\n  - expands on previous day's idea\n  - problem statement: For asking basic (research) questions on state of scientific knowledge, there's basically WebMD or ChatGPT or diving directly into research papers. The first two have a lot of issues with reliability, bias, outdated info, and straight up factual errors. The latter is extremely time consuming. We need a better user interface to the giant database of knowledge that is publicly available research articles.\n  - unique ai opportunity: AI isn't good at reasoning (yet), but is good at collecting or processing unstructured data. It is possible that the database of public research articles could be be made into a database of more well-structured data.\n  - app: Get references with context from a bunch of academic papers with context, and combine them all together to get a graph of references which automatically.\n    - Like basically treat papers as an org-roam database by itself\n    - questions\n      - can we use existing data? the [[id:ebbd29ef-13cf-4846-86d0-2ec617c3851a][LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models]] article mentioned they used arxiv as one of their data sources. Maybe we could process this in a way to create a useful database?\n  - app: simple chat interface that DOES NOT LIE (without references). Use smart RAG for this.\n  - [[id:cddc46b9-df1f-44bb-9a1a-1bebf19a8bbc][rich hickey]] questions\n    - where are you at?\n      AI presents a unique opportunity for crunching unscructured data and I think it could hold promise for making important applications. Ofc [[id:03f07731-cc68-432c-9d16-9c2944f6a21c][yc]] encourages starting at a product and working back to technology, so maybe I'm just trying to hop on the wave. Regardless, I think it would be useful to have this in my toolbox.\n\n      I think there could be important / useful applications to make genetics research or health research or any research more usable. Also, to prevent false information / bullshit that I see, especially in the health space from holding as much traction. If you had a tool where you could easily look up and get to ground truth / state of research for things, that would help eradicate bullshit.\n\n      If I don't do this, will someone else? i.e. is it important?\n\n    - where are you going? - figure out what the limits are of the technology for some specific applications in this knowledge space. Specifically this RAG stuff\n    - what do you know?\n      - RAG seems extremely useful if done in a smart way as with [[id:1d1266d0-e7bc-47fe-8168-7ae25dba54aa][Atlas]]. But the way most people are doing it with pinecone.io, stupidly feeding into the model. It needs to be aligned / trained with the model.\n      - Small models can do surprisingly well in terms of language understanding. e.g. [[id:a2699455-f701-405f-8463-6e6d06538d47][Minstral 7B]] and [[id:c7d53411-bd15-4dec-9750-fee92d5d3040][phi-2]].\n    - what do you need to know?\n      - can you combine small models & finetune them w/ RAG & also finetune the RAG to make a small model with great memory recall that can make authoritative citations?\n        - where do you do RAG?\n          - i.e. can you do after encoder step or as totally separate thing like w/ Atlas\n        - how do you train the RAG?\n        - how do you do the fine tuning of LLM w/ the RAG?\n        - how do you feed in the references? like do we need [[id:4cb370d8-30c8-4881-8725-12b7e90cfc51][Longformer]].\n\n- Minstral RAG\n  - Questions:\n    - where do you add retrieval?\n      - Atlas does this as totally separate thing before the model, but gets the gradient from the model\n      - but I *think* you could do this after the encoder step but before the decoder step?\n    -\n  - focus areas:\n    - fine tuning so we can do this with RAG\n    - specific model arch\n    -\n** 2023-12-22\nIdeas\n- RAG for [[id:a2699455-f701-405f-8463-6e6d06538d47][Minstral 7B]] seems like a dope idea still.

You should be able to put an arbitrary sequence in there and just get related sequences.\n[[id:1d1266d0-e7bc-47fe-8168-7ae25dba54aa][Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models]]\n\n** 2023-12-17\nideas:\n- fine tune one of the llama's or minstral LLM to be able to do RAG. Would have to break it down and see if encoder-decoder or what low level of the model is.\n- find tune a voice translation model to instead of conditionally generating on voice tokens, have the autoregressive decoder condition on text tokens that is a description of a voice.\n\nA retrieval augmentation would be a great way at model introspection! That's a huge problem rn. Then it can know what it doesn't know by figuring out the distance between related knowledge. If ALL it's knowledge is stored in a database, that would be huge.\n\n[[id:1d1266d0-e7bc-47fe-8168-7ae25dba54aa][Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models]]\n\n** 2023-12-11\n\n- a16z podcast\n- random ai\n\nhttps://erichartford.com/uncensored-models\n\ndownload quantized llama2 models [[https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf][here]], from  [[https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/8a7b2fa528f130631a5f43648481596ab320ed5a/README.md#L782][llama ccp]].\n\nnote: for work laptop, couldn't use homebrew gcc, had to overwrite\nCC, CXX with gcc & g++, which use clang\n\n[idk where this thought came from]\n\nSo I think in general, it makes sense to invest time in order to deeply understand these few powerful concepts in the field.

in late 70's was the first time elites created the modern \"right\" and teamed\n    up with the evangelical christians / the \"moral majority\"\n  - this \"freedom\" is based on a single conception of rights. Rights inheritly\n    conflict. \"unalienable rights\" are really just those rights a country with a\n    monopoly on violence chooses to enforce\n  - rights to private property and profit trump all other conceptions of inalienable rights\n    - \"necessitous men are not free men\" and \"an empty stomach was not conductive to freedom\"\n      - i.e. if you have to work just to survive, you aren't free.\n  - \"the assumption that individual freedoms are guaranteed by freedom of the market and\n    of trade is a cardinal feature of neoliberalism\"\n- china's growth is really the result of the largest pool of slave labor ever accumulated\n  - they stopped giving poor country workers benefits, retirement, health care, etc.\n  - sometimes they don't even pay them\n  - them *move backwards* in

currency regime around the world\n- created fixed era\n- we decide every country's currency is pinned to the us doller, that's pegged to Gold\n  - if anyone wan't to convert pounds to dollars, they have to go to central bank\n  - then if there's bunch of ppl wanting to convert, then they have to devalue the foreign\n    currency\n- there werent banking chrisisies, but there were currency

inequality must necessarily be increasing\n  - there was a point in the late 50s when they got close, but theyve been diverging since. the divergence is\n    even accelerating\n  - starts at year

Not because of the\norganization or the job, but because of me. Mostly getting:\n- feeling of failure\n- procrastination\n- feeling overwhelmed\n- less motivation\nat least on the list of symptoms. Lack of motivation has already started in the\nsense of wanting to work on the weekends and stuff. And not wanting to code\nclojure on the weekends as much.\n\nIf I keep up the stressful patters, this thing is gonna break down and I'm\ngoing to lose motivation completely. That's what happened at Walmart.\n\nCauses:\n- Having rough days because of bad digestion has been hard. I think that's been a\n  huge factor actually.\n- My expectations are a little high. So it's hard to meet them.\n- I over-promise.\n\nAt the same time it says working too much is a cause of burnout. So maybe it's\ngood that I've slowed down on the hours.\nQuitting coffee changed this a lot. Was working like 14 hour days before quitting\nand now not at all. Could barely do 8 last week.\n\nBut idk maybe it's just a physical battle and this reflection only serves to\nincrease how seriously I take my physical health bc it shows how bad it can ruin\nmy whole life if not dealt with properly.\n" 536870913] [135 :nodes/created-time "20210321084713" 536870913] [135 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [135 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210321084713-burnout_prevention_and_recovery.org" 536870913] [135 :nodes/id "684beca0-7f73-4988-8a13-2e72198247f2" 536870913] [135 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [135 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [135 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [135 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [135 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20210321084713-burnout_prevention_and_recovery", "ID" "684beca0-7f73-4988-8a13-2e72198247f2", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210321084713-burnout_prevention_and_recovery.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [135 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [135 :nodes/title "burnout-prevention-and-recovery" 536870913] [135 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [135 :nodes/value 3.240000158548355 536870913] [136 :links/dest "\"903253ec-c378-4afd-881c-195447e4e4cb\"" 536870913] [136 :links/pos 92 536870913] [136 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [136 :links/source "\"f31487c6-759e-48cb-bd1b-48871eb35503\"" 536870913] [136 :links/type "\"id\"" 536870913] [136 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       f31487c6-759e-48cb-bd1b-48871eb35503\n:END:\n#+title: neoliberalism\n\n[[id:903253ec-c378-4afd-881c-195447e4e4cb][liberalism]]\n" 536870913] [136 :nodes/created-time "20220412133023" 536870913] [136 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [136 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220412133023-neoliberalism.org" 536870913] [136 :nodes/id "f31487c6-759e-48cb-bd1b-48871eb35503" 536870913] [136 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [136 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [136 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [136 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [136 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220412133023-neoliberalism", "ID" "f31487c6-759e-48cb-bd1b-48871eb35503", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220412133023-neoliberalism.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [136 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [136 :nodes/title "neoliberalism" 536870913] [136 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [136 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [137 :links/dest "\"//www.evolvingground.org/opening-awareness/11\"" 536870913] [137 :links/pos 978 536870913] [137 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [137 :links/source "\"99e82a29-42ac-47fb-9396-e738b314707a\"" 536870913] [137 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [137 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       99e82a29-42ac-47fb-9396-e738b314707a\n:END:\n#+title: opening awareness\n\n[[id:69b9e520-60df-42d5-b193-0bbc7a2521ef][meditation]]\n\nA meditation practice book.

Your work provides great value to me,\nso thank you!\n\nI have a few questions regarding your recent video with Kelly Hogan because I've\nbeen having some gut issues and sporatic fat intolerance. Why do you think you\nhad fat intolerance, and how did you overcome it? And why do you think that\nworked?\n\n\n\ndidnt send this:\n\n\nYou mention that keeping insulin low w/ lower protein & higher fat could help,\nbut this can be hard given the fat intolerance. Also, I'm curious how you think\nthis might affect microbiome.\n\nI've had sporatic fat intolerance. It magically went away, but I'm noticing it\ncome back to a certain extent.\n\nMy theory is that some microbiome issue causes the fat intolerance, which causes\nless bile acid to activate FXR (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16473946/), which\ncauses SIBO, which causes inflammation, higher insulin, and more fat intolerance.\n\n\n\nIs this the best way to improve microbiome?\n  #+end_quote\n" 536870913] [139 :nodes/created-time "20210710111744" 536870913] [139 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [139 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210710111744-amber_o_hearn.org" 536870913] [139 :nodes/id "82365fe3-8d59-4ae4-841e-2830f02d251a" 536870913] [139 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [139 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [139 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [139 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [139 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20210710111744-amber_o_hearn", "ID" "82365fe3-8d59-4ae4-841e-2830f02d251a", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210710111744-amber_o_hearn.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [139 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [139 :nodes/title "amber o'hearn" 536870913] [139 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [139 :nodes/value 5.340277850627899 536870913] [140 :links/dest "\"//discord.com/channels/872184419723653190/1100830805984550953\"" 536870913] [140 :links/pos 430 536870913] [140 :links/properties "(:outline (\"dischord\" \"links\"))" 536870913] [140 :links/source "\"c713222f-febb-4835-9a24-067ac38bbf66\"" 536870913] [140 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [140 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       c713222f-febb-4835-9a24-067ac38bbf66\n:END:\n#+title: evolving ground\n\n[[id:1eca4241-9815-471f-900c-d8864678ba9f][david chapman]]'s spouse, [[id:fca28ce7-919c-41fd-857c-0b2be66ea4da][charlie awbery]]' founded this meditation group for Vajrayana\n\n** dischord\n\n*** links\n\nUVA talks, [[https://discord.com/channels/872184419723653190/1126489045502005338][cognition and science]] and maybe effects of vajrayana\n[[https://discord.com/channels/872184419723653190/1100830805984550953][budhism: not a science of mind]]\n" 536870913] [140 :nodes/created-time "20230825171923" 536870913] [140 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [140 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20230825171923-evolving_ground.org" 536870913] [140 :nodes/id "c713222f-febb-4835-9a24-067ac38bbf66" 536870913] [140 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [140 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [140 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [140 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [140 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20230825171923-evolving_ground", "ID" "c713222f-febb-4835-9a24-067ac38bbf66", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20230825171923-evolving_ground.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [140 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [140 :nodes/title "evolving ground" 536870913] [140 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [140 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [141 :links/dest "\"//sci-hub.se/10.3390/ijms22126242\"" 536870913] [141 :links/pos 1155 536870913] [141 :links/properties "(:outline (\"Interaction between Lipopolysaccharide and Gut Microbiota in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases\"))" 536870913] [141 :links/source "\"3f2f352f-af50-4b01-ae2c-791bbb145ee1\"" 536870913] [141 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [141 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       3f2f352f-af50-4b01-ae2c-791bbb145ee1\n:ROAM_ALIASES: lipopolysaccharide\n:END:\n#+title: lps\n\n[[id:b77d4578-bc50-42a8-94c4-b11d27f78837][food]]\n\n\n** Protective effects of glycine against lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal apoptosis and inflammation\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       f48d481f-7d28-4b1a-bec3-e236f600fb9f\n:END:\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-021-03011-w\n\ncrazy! so maybe meat stock is actually super good!\n\n5 mg/kg for rats. equivalent to humans, divide by 7.4 according to\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/\n\nso for me, 30g of glycine!\n\nit probably needs fat to be absoarbed correctly\n\naccording to this, https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/94/6/2603/4702294\nmuscle meat is only like 4% glycine!\nSo I'm getting like none!\n\n** Interaction between Lipopolysaccharide and Gut Microbiota in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases\nCandelli, M.; Franza, L.; Pignataro, G.; Ojetti, V.; Covino, M.; Piccioni, A.; Gasbarrini, A.; Franceschi, F.

documentation\nhttps://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/index.html\n\n*** modules and classes\n*self* refers to the object that defines the current scope.\n\n- classes are like modules, but can't be mixed-in to another module or class\n- The singleton class (also known as the metaclass or eigenclass)\n** ruby essentials\nhttps://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Essentials\n\n\"Ruby is an object-oriented interpreted scripting language.\"\n\nclass variable\n- is a variable that is shared amongst all instances of a class\n- starts with @@\n\ninstance variable\n- starts with @\n** ruby wikibook\nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming\n\n*** Overview\nEvery value in Ruby is an object. Every object has a class and exactly one\nsuprclass besides BasicObject.\n\nEvery class has\n  - a set of methods which MUST BE called on an object. No statics.\n  - instance variables which are COMPLETELY PRIVATE\n\nModules\n  - has methods, just like a class, but it has no instances.\n    Instead, a module can be included, or “mixed in,” to a class, which adds the\n    methods of that module to the class.\n    - very much like inheritance but far more flexible because a class can\n      include many different modules\n    - these are great. maybe like traits. put individual features in separate\n      modules and they can be combined to make a mess like Ekata's scala Client\n      library.\n\nDynamic\n- can add methods to any class at runtime\n- dynamically typed\n- When you call a method on an object, Ruby looks up the method by name alone —\n  it doesn't care about the type of the object. This is called duck typing and\n  it lets you make classes that can pretend to be other classes, just by\n  implementing the same methods.\n- everything can be changed at runtime.\n  - classes, methods, behavior of standard library\n\nSingleton Classes\n- every object has two classes: a “regular” class and a singleton class.\n- is created per-object and is initially empty, but you can add methods, which\n  can be called on the object\n\nMetaprogramming\n- Every class is an instance of the class Class and every module is an instance\n  of the class Module.\n\nVariables and Scope\n- The name of the variable automatically determines its scope.\n- `x` is a local variable\n- `$x` is a global variable.\n- `@x` is an instance variable.\n- `@@x` is a class variable.\n\nBlocks\n- are closures\n*** Running\n`irb` - interactive ruby, repl\n`ruby script_name.rb` - run the script\n\n`puts` prints and adds a newline\n\n`print` does no newline\n\ndouble quotes you can escape stuff, single quotes you can't really escape\nanything\n\nstring interp: =\"taco #{my_variable}\"=\n\ncan also quote in other ways:\n    %q(abc) is the same as 'abc'\n    %Q(abc's) is the same as \"abc's\"\n\ncan choose your own delimiter? use %Q if you want to interpolate and not escape\n    %q!taco racko saco!\n*** objects\nin Ruby EVERYTHING is an object. No primitives like Java or C++\n\n- an object can do exactly 3 things\n  - hold state, i.e. references to other objects\n  - receive a message from itself or others\n  - in course of processing, send message to itself or others.\n\n#+begin_src ruby :results output\na = \"taco\"\nb = a\nputs b\n# add or remove the exclaimation point!\nputs a.upcase!\nputs a, b\n#+end_src\n\n#+RESULTS:\n: taco\n: TACO\n: taco\n: taco\n\nMethods that end w/ exclaimation mark modify the object\n\nMethods that do not end in an exclamation point return data, but do not modify\nthe object.\n\nObjects have\n\n*** variables\nbasic local vars start with either a lower case letter or an underscore, and\nshould contain upper or lower case letters, numbers, and underscore characters.\n\nglobals start with $\n\nAs with variables, local and class methods should start with a lower case letter.\n\nNow THIS is stupid:\n  Functions interact with blocks through `yield`.\n\n#+begin_src ruby :results output\ndef my_func\n  yield \"bongo\", 'cock'\n  yield\nend\n\nmy_func { |x, y| puts \"beust #{x}#{y}.\" }\n#+end_src\n\n#+RESULTS:\n: beust bongocock.\n: beust .\n\nconstants start w/ capital letters\n*** symbols / data types\nsee https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Data_types\n\nlightweight objects that have identity\n\n#+begin_src ruby :results output\nputs \"taco\".object_id, \"taco\".object_id\nputs :taco.object_id, :taco.object_id\n#+end_src\n\n#+RESULTS:\n: 60\n: 80\n: 1045148\n: 1045148\n" 536870913] [145 :nodes/created-time "20221006154330" 536870913] [145 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [145 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221006154330-ruby_language.org" 536870913] [145 :nodes/id "a2636b35-542d-45ba-aa89-15cc269fc074" 536870913] [145 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [145 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [145 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [145 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [145 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20221006154330-ruby_language", "ID" "a2636b35-542d-45ba-aa89-15cc269fc074", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221006154330-ruby_language.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [145 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [145 :nodes/title "ruby language" 536870913] [145 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [145 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [146 :links/dest "\"cd2c0a01-c5ce-4474-831f-041edee42bb3\"" 536870913] [146 :links/pos 164 536870913] [146 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [146 :links/source "\"6c6d9151-eff9-46ea-9d8b-a613f3341911\"" 536870913] [146 :links/type "\"id\"" 536870913] [146 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       6c6d9151-eff9-46ea-9d8b-a613f3341911\n:END:\n#+title: rapamycin\n\n[[id:f08e30aa-e83b-451f-88b7-fe954bab2f6e][supplements]]\n\ngot the idea from [[id:cd2c0a01-c5ce-4474-831f-041edee42bb3][peter attia]]\n" 536870913] [146 :nodes/created-time "20221211122251" 536870913] [146 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [146 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221211122251-rapamycin.org" 536870913] [146 :nodes/id "6c6d9151-eff9-46ea-9d8b-a613f3341911" 536870913] [146 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [146 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [146 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [146 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [146 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20221211122251-rapamycin", "ID" "6c6d9151-eff9-46ea-9d8b-a613f3341911", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221211122251-rapamycin.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [146 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [146 :nodes/title "rapamycin" 536870913] [146 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [146 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [147 :links/dest "\"793f1b7c-84c5-44c0-b818-80bdeb5df1cd\"" 536870913] [147 :links/pos 1849 536870913] [147 :links/properties "(:outline (\"small and large intestine malabsorbtion of nutrients\"))" 536870913] [147 :links/source "\"34cf2840-1d8d-4283-b6ff-58287196b719\"" 536870913] [147 :links/type "\"id\"" 536870913] [147 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       34cf2840-1d8d-4283-b6ff-58287196b719\n:END:\n#+title: nutrient malabsorbtion\n\n[[id:4e007f1e-3e2b-4c96-98f0-58260d6ed0e2][sibo]]\n\n** basic physiology summary\nhttps://sci-hub.se/http://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00094.2009\n\n\"Since digestive lipases have adapted to being more efficient at oil-water\ninterfaces, turning dietary fat into an emulsion of fine oil\ndroplets enhances the action of lipases (4).

So\ntheoretically, you could add the US RDA to this (which is 64g for 80kg person).\nBut this is still dangerous.\n\n#+begin_quote\nHence, for an 80 kg individual, 285 g protein per day should be viewed as an\nabsolute maximum. Even this amount would be equivalent to the consumption of\napproxi- mately 1 kg of lean meat per day.\n#+end_quote\n\nThis is crazy! I was eating like way more than this sometimes! Stefansson\n(72.5kg) actually got sick during the first three days of his hospital\nexperiment bc he had 264 g/d of protein.\n\nThey go on to say you could have half that and get some benefits from using\nprotein as energy:\n\n#+begin_quote\nThe advantage being that this protein could displace fat or carbohydrate from\nthe diet, increase satiety (plus yield less energy due to its higher rate of\nthermogenesis) thus helping in weight control, a controversial but promising\narea of research and will be discussed later.\n#+end_quote\n\nBut I personally think using protein as energy makes me feel like shit.\n\nOther animal carnivores upregulate protein-breakdown pathway enzymes, but...\n\n#+begin_quote\nOther studies, however, show that when animals are faced with large protein\nloads, the rate of gastric emptying is reduced as the catabolic and anabolic\nsystems of the body become saturated, unable to deal with an excess of dietary\nnitrogen under acute conditions (32)... To what degree do these processes\ntranspire in humans, and at what threshold intake of protein is currently\nunknown as very little data have been collected on humans consuming high protein\ndiets for prolonged periods of time.\n#+end_quote\n\nSo maybe this is why I do better with rendered fat if it's alongside some meat!\n\n\n\nprotein absoarbtion\n\nThere aren't very good studies on this. They kind of have to go about it in a\nroundabout way and guess.\n\nFor tenderloin pork, they gave them some pork and then looked at the\npostprandial blood amino acid profile. Then they injected that mixed amino acid\nprofile into subjects at various rates (6, 10, and 14 g/h). The subsequent blood\nprofile matching the one of the ingested steak was 10 g/h. So maybe we assume a\nmeal of 36 g of protein and 20 g fat would be absoarbed at 10 g/h, i.e. it'd be\nfully absoarbed after 3.6 hours.\n\nWhey is 8-10g/h, casein is ~6.1.\n\nHe has a table!!\n\nRaw egg protein is extremely slow! Cooked is over 2x better. He doesn't have\nmeat to compare to this stuff tho :/.\n\nThis is quite slow compared to fat ~0.175g ∙ kg^-1 ∙h^-1 (~14g/h) and glucose\n0.8-1.2g carb ∙ kg-1 ∙ h-1 (60-100g/h) for an 80 kg individual\n" 536870913] [157 :nodes/created-time "20221119141013" 536870913] [157 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [157 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221119141013-a_review_of_issues_of_dietary_protein_intake_in_humans_by_shane_bilsborough_and_neil_mann.org" 536870913] [157 :nodes/id "af90c362-ba7e-42d8-8a62-017d2749d784" 536870913] [157 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [157 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [157 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [157 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [157 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20221119141013-a_review_of_issues_of_dietary_protein_intake_in_humans_by_shane_bilsborough_and_neil_mann", "ID" "af90c362-ba7e-42d8-8a62-017d2749d784", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221119141013-a_review_of_issues_of_dietary_protein_intake_in_humans_by_shane_bilsborough_and_neil_mann.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [157 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [157 :nodes/title "A Review of Issues of Dietary Protein Intake in Humans by Shane Bilsborough and Neil Mann" 536870913] [157 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [157 :nodes/value 2.5416666865348816 536870913] [158 :links/dest "\"//github.com/noctuid/general.el#override-keymaps-and-buffer-local-keybindings\"" 536870913] [158 :links/pos 725 536870913] [158 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [158 :links/source "\"41037687-6d0b-466d-8ca7-1528b74c9eff\"" 536870913] [158 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [158 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       41037687-6d0b-466d-8ca7-1528b74c9eff\n:END:\n#+title: paredit mode\n\n[[id:e5e65dfc-85e0-4c9a-986c-14db1deaf453][evil keybindings]]\n\nTODO:\n- review [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/wiki/Quick-tour][smartparens quick tour]]\n- and [[https://github.com/expez/evil-smartparens][this]] for lang-specific configs\nseems like there's not a widespread keybinding default, most ppl just make their own mappings\nthis [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b9ubvn/evil_smartparens_what_keybindings_do_you_use/][redit thread]] is useful\n\n=set-transient-keymap= might be the move\n- this would be in a minor mode\n\nfinished! was actually super easy using minor mode plus =evil-define-minor-mode-key=\n\nalso used [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el#override-keymaps-and-buffer-local-keybindings][general.el]] for keymaps\n" 536870913] [158 :nodes/created-time "20210327091753" 536870913] [158 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [158 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210327091753-paredit_mode.org" 536870913] [158 :nodes/id "41037687-6d0b-466d-8ca7-1528b74c9eff" 536870913] [158 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [158 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [158 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [158 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [158 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20210327091753-paredit_mode", "ID" "41037687-6d0b-466d-8ca7-1528b74c9eff", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20210327091753-paredit_mode.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [158 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [158 :nodes/title "paredit mode" 536870913] [158 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [158 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [159 :links/dest "\"//twitter.com/TuckerGoodrich/status/1658944353887457280\"" 536870913] [159 :links/pos 2170 536870913] [159 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [159 :links/source "\"9d53a16a-8849-42fc-a9cb-a0fdee24a61e\"" 536870913] [159 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [159 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       9d53a16a-8849-42fc-a9cb-a0fdee24a61e\n:END:\n#+title: seed oils\n\n[[id:406a4a8d-4aa4-4538-9294-0a6097df0cc5][Peter Dobromylskyj]]\n[[id:d479f2d2-0cbb-4c91-a263-2ab6f504ca78][tucker goodrich]]\n[[id:31fde7cb-45ac-4656-8eb5-67b0406794e0][fire in a bottle]]\n\nAre all talkers of this. But I want to have a unified theory.\n\nSo Peter basically says that linoleic acids don't produce as much ROS, and\ntherefore cause the fat cells to absoarb more fat than they would otherwise\n(that is, stay insulin sensitive). Basically, seed oils are no big deal, they\njust make you fat and tired.\n\nTucker thinks they get in your shit and fuck you up and cause all sorts of\noxidative damage bc these polyunsaturated fats will get incorperated into your\nmembraines and then explode at the first hint of oxidation and bring the whole\nstructure down with it.\n\nThis has a good overview of the two broad seed oil theories and has some\ninteresting stuff about fat and protein\nhttps://free2z.com/ambimorph/zpage/carbosis-and-the-seed-oil-theory-part-i\nSame author as ketotic, but this is much more recent. Fun fact, the founder\nof zcash, zooko, is her spouse and co-authored the ketotic blog.\n\nAfaik, Peter  Dobromylskyj, Tucker Goodrich, and Brad Marshall seem to be pretty\ngood resources on the seed oil theories and are most of who I've read on the\nsubject. All are pretty active on twitter too.\n\nFor Peter (my favorite), she just links to Peter's first Proton's post, but that\nblog series is 70 posts long and spans over 10 years, so maybe not best to\nstart. I think miracle of Safflower oil\nhttps://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-miracle-of-safflower-oil.html\ngets to his ideas the fastest, but I'm not sure if they're necessarily the best\nat confincing you of the ideas. I guess the Peter theory is tough because I\ndon't know of a distilled version of it.\n(Also, if you liked the other germ-free rat post,\nhttps://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2007/12/fiaf-whos-fat-is-it-anyway.html).\n\nFor Tucker I think the post she links is pretty good.

Lisp. I say \"new type\" because Lisp represented not just a new\nlanguage but a new way of describing languages. He defined Lisp by\nstarting with a small set of operators, akin to axioms, and then\nusing them to write an interpreter for the language in itself.\n\nHis goal was not to define a programming language in our sense of\nthe word: a language used to tell computers what to do. The Lisp\nin his 1960 paper was meant to be a formal model of computation,\nlike a Turing Machine. McCarthy didn't realize it could be used on\ncomputers till his graduate student Steve Russell suggested it.\n\nThe Lisp in the 1960 paper was missing features you'd need in a\nprogramming language. There were no numbers, for example, or errors,\nor I/O. So when people used it as the basis for languages used to\nprogram computers, such things had to be added. And when they were,\nthe axiomatic approach was dropped.\n\nSo the development of Lisp happened in two parts (though they seem\nto have been interleaved somewhat): a formal phase, represented by\nthe 1960 paper, and an implementation phase, in which this language\nwas adapted and extended to run on computers. Most of the work, as\nmeasured by features, took place in the implementation phase. The\nLisp in the 1960 paper, translated into Common Lisp, is only 53 lines\nof code. It does only as much as it has to in order to interpret\nexpressions. Everything else got added in the implementation phase.\n\nMy hypothesis is that, though an accident of history, it was a good\nthing for Lisp that its development happened in two phases-- that\nthe initial exercise of defining the language by writing an\ninterpreter for it in itself is responsible for a lot of Lisp's best\nqualities. And if so, why not do more of it?\n\nBel is an attempt to answer the question: what happens if, instead of\nswitching from the formal to the implementation phase as soon as\npossible, you try to delay that switch for as long as possible? If\nyou keep using the axiomatic approach till you have something close\nto a complete programming language, what axioms do you need, and what\ndoes the resulting language look like?\n\nI want to be clear about what Bel is and isn't. Although it has a lot\nmore features than McCarthy's 1960 Lisp, it's still only the product\nof the formal phase. This is not a language you can use to program\ncomputers, just as the Lisp in the 1960 paper wasn't. Mainly because,\nlike McCarthy's Lisp, it is not at all concerned with efficiency.\nWhen I define append in Bel, I'm saying what append means, not trying\nto provide an efficient implementation of it.\n\nWhy do this? Why prolong the formal phase? One answer is that it's\nan interesting exercise in itself to see where the axiomatic approach\nleads. If computers were as powerful as we wanted, what would\nlanguages look like?\n\nBut I also believe that it will be possible to write efficient\nimplementations based on Bel, by adding restrictions. If you want a\nlanguage with expressive power, clarity, and efficiency, it may work\nbetter to start with expressive power and clarity, and then add\nrestrictions, than to approach from another direction.\n\nSo if you'd like to try writing an implementation based on Bel,\nplease do. I'll be one of your first users.\n\nI've ended up reproducing a number of things in previous dialects.\nEither their designers got it right, or I'm too influenced by\ndialects I've used to see the right answer; time will tell. I've also\ntried to avoid gratuitous departures from existing Lisp conventions.\nWhich means if you see a departure from existing conventions, there\nis probably a reason for it.\n\n\n\nData\n\nBel has four fundamental data types: symbols, pairs, characters, and\nstreams.\n\nSymbols are words:\n\nfoo\n\nThe names of symbols are case-sensitive, so foo and Foo are distinct\nsymbols.\n\nPairs are pairs of any two things, and are represented thus:\n\n(foo . bar)\n\nThat's a pair of two symbols, foo and bar, but the two halves of a\npair can be anything, including pairs:\n\n(foo . (bar . baz))\n\nThat's a pair of the symbol foo, and the pair (bar . baz).\n\nA character is represented by prepending a backslash to its name. So\nthe letter a is represented as\n\n\\a\n\nCharacters that aren't letters may have longer names. For example the\nbell character, after which Bel is named, is\n\n\\bel\n\nThere is no way of representing a stream. If Bel has to display a\nstream, it prints something that will cause an error if it's read\nback in.\n\nAnything that's not a pair is called an atom. So symbols, characters,\nand streams are atoms.\n\nInstances of the four fundamental types are called objects.\n\n\nLists\n\nWe can use pairs to build lots of different data structures, but the\nmost fundamental way they're used is to make lists, as follows:\n\n1. The symbol nil represents the empty list.\n\n2. If y is a list, then the pair (x . y) is a list of x followed by\n   the elements of y.\n\nHere's a list made from a pair:\n\n(a . nil)\n\nAccording to rule 2, this is a list of the symbol a followed by the\nelements of nil, of which according to rule 1 there are none. So it\nis a list of one element, the symbol a.\n\nBy nesting such pairs we can create lists of any length. Here is a\nlist of two elements, the symbols a and b:\n\n(a . (b . nil))\n\nAnd here is a list of a, b, and c:\n\n(a . (b . (c . nil)))\n\nThis would be an awkward way to express lists, but there is an\nabbreviated notation that's more convenient:\n\n1. The symbol nil can also be represented as ().\n\n2. When the second half of a pair is a list, you can omit the dot\n   before it and the parentheses around it. So (a . (b ...)) can\n   be written as (a b ...).\n\nBy repeated application of these two rules we can transform\n\n(a . (b . (c . nil)))\n\ninto\n\n(a b c)\n\nIn other words, a list can be expressed as its elements within\nparentheses. You wouldn't use dot notation for a list like (a b c)\nunless there was some special reason to.\n\nBecause any object can be part of a pair, the elements of lists can\nthemselves be lists. All these are lists too:\n\n(a (b) c)\n\n((a b c))\n\n(nil)\n\nPairs like these, where if you keep looking at the second half you\neventually hit a nil, are called proper lists. This is a proper\nlist:\n\n(a b c)\n\nand this is not:\n\n(a b . c)\n\nThe empty list is also a proper list.\n\nA pair that's not a proper list is called a dotted list (because\nyou need to use dot notation to represent it).\n\nA proper list of characters is called a string, and can also be\nrepresented as those characters within double-quotes. So the list\n\n(\\h \\e \\l \\l \\o)\n\ncan also be represented as\n\n\"hello\"\n\nand will when possible be displayed that way.\n\n\nTruth\n\nThe symbol nil represents falsity as well as the empty list. The\nsymbol t is the default representation for truth, but any object\nother than nil also counts as true.\n\nIt may seem strange to use the same value to represent both falsity\nand the empty list, but in practice it works well. Lisp functions\noften return sets of answers, and the empty set of answers is\nfalsity.\n\n\nFunctions\n\nBel programs consist mostly of functions. Functions take zero or more\nobjects as arguments, perhaps do something (e.g. print a message),\nand return one object.\n\nFunctions are represented using lists. For example, here is a\nfunction that takes one argument, and returns that plus 1.\n\n(lit clo nil (x) (+ x 1))\n\nThe first element, lit, says that this is a literal object, not to be\nevaluated.\n\nThe second, clo, says what kind of literal it is: a closure.\n\nThe third is the local enviroment, a list of variables that already\nhave values from having been parameters of functions. This example\nhas an empty environment.\n\nThe fourth, (x), is the function's parameters. When the function is\ncalled, the value of x will be whatever it was called with.\n\nThe fifth and last element, (+ x 1), defines the value that the\nfunction returns.\n\nYou would not ordinarily express a function using its literal\nrepresentation. Usually you'd say\n\n(fn (x) (+ x 1))\n\nwhich yields the function above.\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe execution of a Bel program consists of the evaluation of\nexpressions. All Bel objects are expressions, so the word \"expression\"\nis merely a statement of intention: it means an object that you\nexpect to be evaluated.\n\nWhen an expression is evaluated, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. It can return a value: (+ 1 2) returns 3.\n\n2. It can cause an error: (/ 1 0) will.\n\n3. It can fail to terminate: (while t) will.\n\nSome expressions also do things in the process of being evaluated.\nFor example,\n\n(prn 1)\n\nwill return 1, but before doing so will print it.\n\nSome atoms evaluate to themselves. All characters and streams do,\nalong with the symbols nil, t, o, and apply. All other symbols\nare variable names, and either evaluate to some value, or cause an\nerror if they don't have a value.\n\nA proper list whose first element evaluates to a function is called\na function call. For example, the expression\n\n(+ x 1)\n\nis a function call, because the value of + is a function. The value\nof a function call is the object that the function returns.\n\nFunction calls are evaluated left to right. For example, when\n\n(+ 8 5)\n\nis evaluated,\n\n1. First + is evaluated, returning a function that returns the sum\n   of its arguments.\n\n2. Then 8 is evaluated, returning itself.\n\n3. Then 5 is evaluated, also returning itself.\n\n4. Finally, the two numbers are passed to the function, which returns\n   13.\n\nIf we want to show what expressions evaluate to, it's conventional to\nshow them being evaluated in a repl:\n\n> (+ 8 5)\n13\n\nExpressions can be nested. The rule of evaluating left to right means\nthat nested function calls are evaluated depth-first. For example,\nwhen\n\n(+ (- 5 2) 7)\n\nis evaluated, the subexpressions that get evaluated are, in order,\n+, (- 5 2), -, 5, 2, 7.\n\nNot all expressions are evaluated left to right, however. =There is a=\n=small set of symbols called special forms=, and an expression whose\nfirst element is a special form is evaluated according to rules\ndefined for that special form.\n\nFor example, if is a special form, and when an expression of the form\n\n(if test then else)\n\nis evaluated, only one of the last two elements will be evaluated,\ndepending on whether the second element, test, returns true or not.\n\nThings meant to be used as the first element of an expression are\ncalled operators. So =functions and special forms are operators=. But\nlike the term \"expression,\" this is just a statement of intention.\nYou can put anything first in an expression so long as you specify\nwhat happens when you do.\n\n\nBindings and Environments\n\n=There are three ways a variable can have a value.= It can have a value\nglobally, as for example + does, meaning that by default it has this\nvalue everywhere. Such a variable is said to be globally bound, and\nthe set of global bindings is called the global environment.\n\nAnother way a variable can have a value is by being a parameter in a\nfunction. When the function\n\n(fn (x) (+ x 1))\n\nis called, the variable x will, within it, have as its value whatever\nargument the function was called with. That's called a lexical\nbinding, and the current set of lexical bindings is the lexical\nenvironment.\n\nFinally, variables can have dynamic bindings, which are visible\neverywhere, like global bindings, but temporary: they persist only\nduring the evaluation of whatever expression created them.\n\n=Dynamic bindings take precendence over lexical bindings, which take=\n=precedence over global ones.=\n\nIf you do an assignment to a variable that has one of the three kinds\nof bindings, you'll modify whichever binding is currently visible. If\nyou do an assignment to a variable that's not bound, you'll create a\nglobal binding for it.\n\n\nErrors\n\nErrors are signalled by calling err with one argument describing the\nerror. Bel doesn't specify a global binding for err; this is\nsomething for a programming environment built on top of Bel to do.\nBut some error-catching code in the Bel source does dynamically bind\nerr.\n\n\nAxioms\n\nLike McCarthy's Lisp, Bel is defined starting with a set of operators\nthat we have to assume already exist. Then more are defined in terms\nof these, till finally we can define a function that is a Bel\ninterpreter, meaning a function that takes a Bel expression as an\nargument and evaluates it.\n\n=There are two main types of axioms: primitives and special forms.=\n- *special forms defined in bel source. primitives are axioms*\n=There are also a few variables that come predefined.=\n\nIn the following sections, the descriptions of primitives are their\ndefinitions. The descriptions of special forms, however, are merely\nsummaries of their behavior; special forms are defined by the code\nthat implements them in the Bel source.\n\n\nVariables and Constants\n\n1. t nil o apply\n\nEvaluate to themselves.\n\n2. chars\n\nA list of all characters. Its elements are of the form (c . b), where\nc is a character and b is its binary representation in the form of a\nstring of \\1 and \\0 characters. Bel doesn't specify which characters\nare in chars, but obviously they should include at least those in the\nBel source.\n\n3. globe scope\n\nThe current global and lexical environments, represented as lists of\n(var . val) pairs of variables and their values.\n\n4. ins outs\n\nThe default input and output streams. Initially nil, which represents\nthe initial input and output streams. Bel doesn't specify what those\nare, but if you started Bel at a prompt you'd expect them to be the\nterminal.\n\n\nQuote\n\nThe quote operator is a special form, but it has to be described\nfirst because so many code examples use it.\n\nIt returns its argument without evaluating it. Its purpose is to\nprevent evaluation.\n\n> (quote a)\na\n\nPrepending ' to an expression is equivalent to wrapping a quote\naround it.\n\n> 'a\na\n\nWhy do you need to prevent evaluation? To distinguish between code\nand data. If you want to talk about the symbol a, you have to quote\nit. Otherwise it will be treated as a variable, and you'll get its\nvalue. E.g. if a has been set to 10:\n\n> a\n10\n> 'a\na\n\nBecause the symbols nil, t, o, and apply evaluate to themselves, you\ndon't have to quote them. Ditto for strings.\n\n\nPrimitives\n\n=Primitives can be called like functions, but are assumed to exist=,\nrather than defined in the Bel source. As with function calls, the\narguments in calls to primitives are all evaluated, left to right.\nMissing arguments default to nil. Extra arguments cause an error to\nbe signalled.\n\n\n1.  (id x y)\n\nReturns true iff x and y are identical.\n\n> (id 'a 'a)\nt\n> (id 'a 'b)\nnil\n\n=Identity is stricter than equality.= While there is only one of each\nsymbol and character, there can be any number of different pairs with\nthe same elements. So two pairs can look the same without being\nidentical:\n\n> (id '(a b) '(a b))\nnil\n\nBecause id is so strict, it's not the function you'd usually use to\ntest for equality. Usually you'd use =.\n\n\n2.  (join x y)\n\nReturns a new pair whose first half is x and second half is y.\n\n> (join 'a 'b)\n(a . b)\n> (join 'a)\n(a)\n\nA pair returned by join will not be id to any existing pair.\n\n> (id (join 'a 'b) (join 'a 'b))\nnil\n\n\n3.  (car x)\n\nReturns the first half of a pair:\n\n> (car '(a . b))\na\n> (car '(a b))\na\n\nThe car of nil is nil,\n\n> (car nil)\nnil\n\nbut calling car on any atom other than nil will cause an error.\n\nThe name \"car\" is McCarthy's. It's a reference to the architecture of\nthe first computer Lisp ran on. But though the name is a historical\naccident, it works so well in practice that there's no reason to\nchange it.\n\n\n4.  (cdr x)\n\nReturns the second half of a pair:\n\n> (cdr '(a . b))\nb\n> (cdr '(a b))\n(b)\n\nAs with car, calling it on nil yields nil, calling it on any other\natom causes an error, and the name is McCarthy's.\n\nWhen operating on pairs used to represent lists, car and cdr get you\nthe first element and the rest of the list respectively.\n\n\n5.  (type x)\n\nReturns either symbol, pair, char, or stream depending on the type\nof x.\n\n> (type 'a)\nsymbol\n> (type '(a))\npair\n> (type \\a)\nchar\n\n\n6.  (xar x y)\n\nReplaces the car of x with y, returning y. Signals an error if x is\nnot a pair.\n\nIf we assume that the value of x is (a . b), then\n\n> x\n(a . b)\n> (xar x 'c)\nc\n> x\n(c . b)\n\n\n7.  (xdr x y)\n\nLike xar, except that it replaces the cdr of x.\n\n> x\n(c . b)\n> (xdr x 'd)\nd\n> x\n(c . d)\n\n\n8.  (sym x)\n\nReturns the symbol whose name is the elements of x. Signals an error\nif x is not a string.\n\n> (sym \"foo\")\nfoo\n\n\n9.  (nom x)\n\nReturns a fresh list of the characters in the name of x. Signals an\nerror if x is not a symbol.\n\n> (nom 'foo)\n\"foo\"\n\n\n10. (wrb x y)\n\nWrites the bit x (represented by either \\1 or \\0) to the stream y.\nReturns x. Signals an error if it can't or if x is not \\1 or \\0. If y\nis nil, writes to the initial output stream.\n\n\n11. (rdb x)\n\nTries to read a bit from the stream x. Returns \\1 or \\0 if it finds\none, nil if no bit is currently available, or eof if no more will be\navailable. Signals an error if it can't. If x is nil, reads from the\ninitial input stream.\n\n\n12. (ops x y)\n\n=Returns a stream that writes to or reads from the place whose name is=\n=the string x=, depending on whether y is out or in respectively.\nSignals an error if it can't, or if y is not out or in.\n\n\n13. (cls x)\n\nCloses the stream x. Signals an error if it can't.\n\n\n14. (stat x)\n\nReturns either closed, in, or out depending on whether the stream x\nis closed, or reading from or writing to something respectively.\nSignals an error if it can't.\n\n\n15. (coin)\n\nReturns either t or nil randomly.\n\n\n16. (sys x)\n\nSends x as a command to the operating system.\n\n\nSpecial Forms\n\nExpressions beginning with special forms are not always evaluated in\nthe usual left-to-right way.\n\n\n1.  (quote x)\n\nDescribed above.\n\n\n2.  (lit ...)\n\nReturns the whole lit expression without evaluating it. =A lit is like=\n=a persistent quote; evaluation strips the quote off a quote=\n=expression, but leaves a lit expression intact.=\n\n> (quote a)\na\n> (lit a)\n(lit a)\n\nThe name stands for literal, and it can take any number of arguments.\n=This is how you make things that evaluate to themselves, the way=\ncharacters or nil do. Functions are lits, for example, as are\nnumbers.\n\n=The value of a primitive p is (lit prim p).=\n\n> car\n(lit prim car)\n\n\n3.  (if ...)\n\nAn if expression with an odd number of arguments\n\n(if a1 a2 a3 a4 ... an)\n\nis equivalent to\n\nif a1 then a2 else if a3 then a4 ... else an\n\nI.e. the odd numbered arguments are evaluated in order till we either\nreach the last, or one returns true.  In the former case, its value\nis returned as the value of the if expression. In the latter, the\nsucceeding argument is evaluated and its value returned.\n\nAn if expression with an even number of arguments\n\n(if a1 a2 ... an)\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(if a1 a2 ... an nil)\n\nFalsity is represented by nil, and truth by any other value. Tests\ngenerally return the symbol t when they can't return anything more\nuseful.\n\nAs a rule I've tried to make axioms as weak as possible. But while\na 3-argument if would have sufficed, an n-argument version didn't\nrequire significantly more code, so it seemed gratuitously fussy to\ninsist on 3 arguments.\n\n\n4.  (apply f ...)\n\nAn expression of the form\n\n(apply f x y ... z)\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(f 'a 'b ... 'c1 ... 'cn)\n\nwhere a is the value of x, b the value of y, and the ci the elements\nof the value of z.\n\n> (join 'a 'b)\n(a . b)\n> (apply join '(a b))\n(a . b)\n> (apply join 'a '(b))\n(a . b)\n\nThe last argument to apply can be a dotted list if it matches the\nparameters of the first.\n\n\n5.  =(where x)= *this one is very strange to me*\n\nEvaluates x. If its value comes from a pair, returns a list of that\npair and either a or d depending on whether the value is stored in\nthe car or cdr. Signals an error if the value of x doesn't come from\na pair.\n\nFor example, if x is (a b c),\n\n> (where (cdr x))\n((a b c) d)\n\n\n6.  (dyn v x y)\n\nEvaluates x, then causes y to be evaluated with the variable v\ndynamically bound to the value of x.\n\nFor example, if x is a,\n\n> x\na\n> (dyn x 'z (join x 'b))\n(z . b)\n> x\na\n\n\n7.  (after x y)\n\nEvaluates both its arguments in order. The second will be evaluated\neven if the evaluation of the first is interrupted (e.g. by an\nerror).\n\n\n8.  (ccc f) *I have no idea what this does* =look into this=\n\nEvaluates f and calls its value on the current continuation. The\ncontinuation, if called with one argument, will return it as the\nvalue of the ccc expression (even if you are no longer in the ccc\nexpression or in code called by it).\n\n\n9.  (thread x)\n\nStarts a new thread in which x will be evaluated. Global bindings are\nshared between threads, but not dynamic ones.\n\n\nReading the Source\n\nStarting with the foregoing 25 operators, we're going to define more,\ntill we can define a Bel interpreter. Then we'll continue, defining\nnumbers, I/O, and several other things one needs in programs.\n\nThese definition are in the Bel source, which is meant to be read in\nparallel with this guide.\n\nIn the Bel source, when you see an expression of the form\n\n(set v1 e1 ... vn en)\n\nit means each vi is globally bound to the value of ei.\n\nIn the source I try not to use things before I've defined them, but\nI've made a handful of exceptions to make the code easier to read.\n\nWhen you see\n\n(def n p e)\n\ntreat it as an abbreviation for\n\n(set n (lit clo nil p e))\n\nand when you see\n\n(mac n p e)\n\ntreat it as an abbreviation for\n\n(set n (lit mac (lit clo nil p e)))\n\nThe actual def and mac operators are more powerful, but this is as\nmuch as we need to start with.\n\nTreat an expression in square brackets, e.g.\n\n[f _ x]\n\nas an abbreviation for\n\n(fn (_) (f _ x))\n\nIn Bel, underscore is an ordinary character and _ is thus an ordinary\nvariable.\n\nFinally, treat an expression with a prepended backquote (`) as a\nquoted list, but with \"holes,\" marked by commas, where evaluation\nis turned back on again.\n\n> (set x 'a)\na\n> `(x ,x y)\n(x a y)\n> `(x ,x y ,(+ 1 2))\n(x a y 3)\n\nYou can also use ,@ to get a value spliced into the surrounding\nlist:\n\n> (set y '(c d))\n(c d)\n> `(a b ,@y e f)\n(a b c d e f)\n\nNow let's look at the source. The first expression defines a function\nno that takes one argument, x, and returns the result of using id to\ncompare it to nil. So no returns t if its argument is nil, and nil\notherwise.\n\n> (no nil)\nt\n> (no 'a)\nnil\n\nSince nil represents both falsity and the empty list, no is both\nlogical negation and the test for the empty list.\n\nThe second function, atom, returns true iff its argument is not a\npair.\n\n> (atom \\a)\nt\n> (atom nil)\nt\n> (atom 'a)\nt\n> (atom '(a))\nnil\n\nNext come a pair of similar functions, all and some. The former\nreturns t iff its first argument returns true of all the elements of\nits second,\n\n> (all atom '(a b))\nt\n> (all atom nil)\nt\n> (all atom '(a (b c) d))\nnil\n\nand the latter returns true iff its first argument returns true of\nany element of its second. However, when some returns true, it\ndoesn't simply return t. It returns the remainder of the list\nstarting from the point where f was true of the first element.\n\n> (some atom '((a b) (c d)))\nnil\n> (some atom '((a b) c (d e)))\n(c (d e))\n\nLogically, any value except nil counts as truth, so why not return\nthe most informative result you can?\n\nIn all and some we see the first use of if. Translated into English,\nthe definition of all might be:\n\n  If xs is empty, then return t.\n\n  Otherwise if f returns true of the first element, return the result\n  of calling all on f and the remaining elements.\n\n  Otherwise (in which case xs has at least one element of which f\n  returns false), return nil.\n\nThis technique of doing something to the car of a list and then\nperhaps continuing down the cdr is very common.\n\nSomething else is new in all and some: these are the first functions\nin the Bel source that you could cause an error by calling.\n\n> (all atom 'a)\nError: can't call car on a non-nil atom.\n\nI made up that error message; Bel doesn't specify more about errors\nin primitives than when they occur, and doesn't specify anything\nabout repls. But some error will be signalled if you call all with a\nnon-nil atom as the second argument, because in the second test\nwithin the if\n\n(f (car xs))\n\ncar is called on it, and it's an error to call car on anything except\na pair or nil.\n\nOne other thing to note about these definitions, now that we're\ngetting to more complex ones: these functions are not defined the\nway they would be in idiomatic Bel. For example, if all didn't\nalready exist in Bel you could define it as simply\n\n(def all (f xs)\n  (~some ~f xs))\n\n=I don't like this. complement is used so infrequently in practice, you should just=\n=spell it rather than dediating a special character to it=\nBut since we haven't defined functional composition yet, I didn't use\nit.\n\nThe next function, reduce, is for combining the elements of its\nsecond argument using nested calls to its first. For example\n=omg he switched the argument order. I'm gonna freak out=\n=no initail value too. seems so impractical. what's his gripe on clojure?=\n\n(reduce f '(a b c d))\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(f 'a (f 'b (f 'c 'd)))\n\nIf xs has only one element, reduce returns it, and if it's empty,\nreduce returns nil; since (cdr nil) is nil, we can check both these\npossibilities with (no (cdr xs)). Otherwise it calls f on the first\nelement and reduce of f and the remaining elements.\n\n> (reduce join '(a b c))\n(a b . c)\n\nThis is not the only way to reduce a list. Later we'll define two\nmore, foldl and foldr.\n\nThe definition of reduce shows another way of indenting ifs.\nIndentation isn't significant in Bel and only matters insofar as\nit helps humans read your code, but I've found three ways of\nindenting ifs that work well. If an if has more than two tests and\nthe arguments are sufficiently short, it works well to say\n\n(if test1 then1\n    test2 then2\n          else)\n\nWe saw this in all and some. But if you only have one test, or some\narguments are too long to fit two on one line, then it works better\nto say\n\n(if test1\n    then1\n    test2\n    then2\n    else)\n\nor if an if is long,\n\n(if test1\n     then1\n    test2\n     then2\n    test3\n     then3\n     else)\n\nThe next function, cons, has the name that join had in McCarthy's\nLisp. It's the function you use to put things on the front of a list.\n\n> (cons 'a '(b c))\n(a b c)\n\nIf you only want to put one thing on the front of a list, you could\nuse join.\n\n> (join 'a '(b c))\n(a b c)\n\nWith cons, however, you can supply more than one thing to put on the\nfront:\n\n> (cons 'a 'b 'c '(d e f))\n(a b c d e f)\n\nSince cons is a generalization of join, it's rare to see join in\nprograms.\n\nWe see something new in the definition of cons: it has a single\nparameter, args, instead of a list of parameters. When a function has\na single parameter, its value will be a list of all the arguments\nsupplied when the function is called. So if we call cons thus\n\n(cons 'a 'b '(c d))\n\nthe value of args will be\n\n(a b (c d))\n\nThe parameter list of a Bel function can be a tree of any shape. If\nthe arguments in the call match its shape, the parameters will get\nthe corresponding values; otherwise an error is signalled.\n\nSo for example if a function f has the parameter list\n\n(x . y)\n\nand it's called\n\n(f 'a 'b 'c)\n\nthen x will be a, and y will be (b c).\n\nIf the same function is called\n\n(f 'a)\n\nthen x will be a, and y will be nil. And if it's called\n\n(f)\n\nyou'll get an error because there is no value for x.\n\nIf a function f has the parameter list\n\n((x y) z)\n\nand is called\n\n(f '(a (b c)) '(d))\n\nthen x will be a, y will be (b c), and z will be (d). Whereas if it's\ncalled\n\n(f '(a) '(d))\n\nyou'll get an error because there is no value for y, and if it's\ncalled\n\n(f '(a b c) '(d))\n\nyou'll get an error because there is no parameter for c.\n\nThe next function, append, joins lists together:\n\n> (append '(a b c) '(d e f))\n(a b c d e f)\n> (append '(a) nil '(b c) '(d e f))\n(a b c d e f)\n\nIts definition will be easier to understand if we look first at a\ntwo-argument version.\n\n(def append2 (xs ys)\n  (if (no xs)\n      ys\n      (cons (car xs) (append2 (cdr xs) ys))))\n\nIn English, if xs is empty, then just return ys. Otherwise return the\nresult of consing the first element of xs onto append of the rest of\nxs and ys. I.e.\n\n(append2 '(a b c) '(d e f))\n\nbecomes\n\n(cons 'a (append2 '(b c) '(d e f)))\n\nand so on. The definition of append in the Bel source is the same\nprinciple applied to any number of arguments.\n\nIn it we see the first use of apply. Like if, apply is a special\nform, meaning an operator whose behavior has to be defined as a\nspecial case in the interpreter. Unlike if, apply has a value; it\nevaluates to itself, like t and nil. This lets you use it as an\nargument like an ordinary function.\n\nIts purpose is in effect to spread out the elements of a list as if\nthey were the arguments in a function call. For example\n\n(apply f '(a b))\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(f 'a 'b)\n\nIn the general case apply can take one or more arguments, and is\nequivalent to calling apply on the first argument and all the\nintervening arguments consed onto the last. I.e.\n\n(apply f x y z)\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(apply f (cons x y z)) =isn't this (x . (y . z))?, so an error?=\n\nIt's common to use apply in functions like append that take any\nnumber of arguments. Using apply is in a sense the converse of using\na single parameter to collect multiple arguments.\n\nNow let's look at append. It takes any number of arguments.\nCollectively (i.e. as a list) they'll be the value of args. If args\nis empty or only has one element, then the result is (car args). We\nsaw the same sort of test in the first clause of reduce. That's two\nbase cases, and there is also a third: when args has more than one\nelement but the first element is nil. In that case we can ignore it,\nand apply append to the rest of args.\n\nFinally in the last clause we see the general case. It uses the\nsame strategy we saw in append2: cons the first element of the\nfirst argument onto a recursive call to append on the rest of the\nfirst argument and the remaining arguments. Unlike append2, append\nhas to make this call using apply, because it has a varying number of\narguments in a list, instead of exactly two.\n\nOnce we have append it's easy to define snoc, which as its name\nsuggests is like a reverse cons,\n\n> (snoc '(a b c) 'd 'e)\n(a b c d e)\n\nand list, which returns a list of its arguments.\n\n> (list)\nnil\n> (list 'a)\n(a)\n> (list 'a 'b)\n(a b)\n\nOr more precisely, returns a newly made list of its arguments. If\nyou're wondering why we bother appending args to nil rather than\nsimply returning it, the reason is that appending a list to nil will\nalso copy it.\n\nIf we defined list as\n\n(def list args args)\n\nand it was called thus\n\n(apply list x)\n\n=then the value that list returned would be the same list as x-- not=\n=merely a list with the same elements, but the same pair-- meaning if=\n*so we don't have immutable mechanics of clojure*\nwe modified the value we got from list, we'd also be modifying the\nobject up in the calling code.\n\nAfter list we see map, which in the simplest case returns a list of\ncalling its first argument on each element of its second.\n\n> (map car '((a b) (c d) (e f)))\n(a c e)\n\nHowever, map can take any number of lists, and calls its first\nargument on successive sets of elements from the others.\n\n> (map cons '(a b c) '(1 2 3))\n((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))\n\nIt stops as soon as one list runs out\n\n> (map cons '(a b c) '(1 2))\n((a . 1) (b . 2))\n\nLike append, map is easier to understand if we start with a version\nthat takes exactly two arguments.\n\n(def map2 (f xs)\n  (if (no xs)\n      nil\n      (cons (f (car xs))\n            (map2 f (cdr xs)))))\n\nIf there are no xs left, then return nil, otherwise cons f of the\nfirst element onto map2 of f and the remaining elements. Pretty\nsimple.\n\nAll the additional complexity of map comes from the need to take\nmultiple lists. The parameter list becomes (f . ls) so that all the\nlists can be collected in ls. We need an additional base case in case\nthere are zero of them. Checking for the end of the list, which in\nmap2 was\n\n(no xs)\n\nnow becomes\n\n(some no ls)\n\nbecause we stop as soon as any list runs out.\n\nThen we have yet another base case, the one in which we have just one\nlist. That's what map2 does, and not surprisingly, the code is the\nsame as in map2 except that xs becomes (car ls).\n\nFinally in the general case we call f on all the first elements\n(which we collect using map) and cons that onto map of f on all the\nrests of the lists.\n\nNotice that map calls itself recursively in two ways: there is the\nusual \"do this to the rest of the list\" recursive call in the last\nline. But in the preceding line we also use (map car ls) to collect\nthe arguments for f. And that's why we need the single-list base\ncase. Without it, we'd get an infinite recursion.\n\nNext comes our first macro, fn. There are two concepts to explain\nfirst, though: macros and scope.\n\nA macro is essentially a function that generates code. I would have\nliked the first example of a macro to be something simpler, but fn\nis the one we need first. So I'll introduce macros using a simpler\nmacro that isn't part of Bel, then explain fn.\n\nHere is a very simple macro:\n\n(mac nilwith (x)\n  (list 'cons nil x))\n\nThis definition says that whenever you see an expression like\n\n(nilwith 'a)\n\ntransform it into\n\n(cons nil 'a)\n\nand then evaluate that and return its value as the value of the call\nto nilwith.\n\n> (nilwith 'a)\n(nil . a)\n\nSo unlike the evaluation of a function call, the evaluation of a\nmacro call has two steps:\n\n1. First use the definition of the macro to generate an expression,\n   called the macro's expansion. In the case above the expansion is\n   (cons nil 'a).\n\n2. Then evaluate the expansion and return the result. The expansion\n   above evaluates to (nil . a).\n\nBeneath the surface, what's going on is quite simple. A macro is in\neffect (or more precisely, contains) a function that generates\nexpressions. This function is called on the (unevaluated) arguments\nin the macro call, and whatever it returns is the macro expansion.\n\nFor example, the value of nilwith will be equivalent to\n\n(lit mac (lit clo nil (x) (list 'cons nil x))))\n\nIf we look at the third element, we see the function that generates\nexpansions\n\n(lit clo nil (x) (list 'cons nil x))\n\nwhich looks just like the definition of nilwith.\n\nMacros often use backquote to make the code that generates\nexpressions look as much as possible like the resulting expressions.\nSo if you defined nilwith you'd probably do it not as we did above\nbut as\n\n(mac nilwith (x)\n  `(cons nil ,x))\n\nNow let's work our way up to fn, starting with the following\nsimplified version:\n\n(mac fn- (parms expr)\n  `(lit clo nil ,parms ,expr))\n\nThis is less powerful than the actual fn macro in two ways.\n\n1. It doesn't capture the local lexical environment, but instead\n   simply inserts a nil environment.\n\n2. It can only take a single expression.\n\nBut if we don't need either of these things, the functions made by\nfn- work fine:\n\n> ((fn- (x y) (cons x y)) 'a 'b)\n(a . b)\n\nAll the extra complexity in the definition of fn is to get those two\nfeatures, the local environment and a body of more than one\nexpression.\n\nA function with a lexical environment stored within it is called a\nclosure. That's why literal Bel functions begin (lit clo ...); the\nclo is for \"closure.\" If a closure includes an environment with a\nvalue for x, then x will have a value within the closure even if it\nisn't a parameter.\n\nSo far the literal functions we've seen have had nil enviroments.\nLet's try making one by hand with some variable bindings in it. An\nenvironment is a list of (var . val) pairs, so to make a closure we\nput such a list in the third position of a clo, like this:\n\n(lit clo ((x . a)) (y) (cons x y))\n\nThis closure includes an environment in which x has the value a. It\nhas one parameter, y, and when called returns the value of x consed\nonto whatever we give as an argument.\n\n> ((lit clo ((x . a)) (y) (cons x y)) 'b)\n(a . b)\n\nNotice that the b was all we passed to the function. The a came from\nwithin it.\n\nIt turns out to be very useful if functions include the lexical\nenvironment where they're created. And that is what the fn macro\ndoes.\n\n=In Bel you can get hold of the global and lexical environments using=\n=the variables globe and scope respectively.= So for example if we\ndefine foo as\n\n(def foo (x)\n  scope)\n\nthen it will work something like this\n\n> (foo 'a)\n((x . a))\n> (foo 'b)\n((x . b))\n\nI say \"something like\" because a repl may have some variables of its\nown, but we know that scope will at least have a value for x.\n\nIf you compare the definitions of fn- and fn, you'll notice that\nwhile fn- expands into a lit expression, fn expands into a call to\nlist that yields a lit expression. It works fine to use a call to\nlist rather than an actual list in a function call; functions are\njust lists after all.\n\n> ((list 'lit 'clo nil '(x) '(+ x 1)) 2)\n3\n\nThe reason the definition of fn expands into a call to list is so\nthat we can incorporate the local environment, which we get by\nincluding scope in the arguments to list.\n\nHere's an example where we do this manually:\n\n(def bar (x)\n  ((list 'lit 'clo scope '(y) '(+ x y)) 2))\n\nWithin bar we call a hand-made closure that includes scope, which, as\nwe know from the example of foo above, will include a value for x.\n\n> (bar 3)\n5\n\nThe fn macro generates as its expansion exactly what we just made by\nhand. So this is equivalent to the definition above:\n\n(def bar (x)\n  ((fn (y) (+ x y)) 2))\n\nThe fn macro has two different expansions depending on how many\narguments we pass to it. That's so that functions can have bodies of\nmore than one expression.\n\nIf we call fn with two arguments, meaning a parameter list and an\nexpression, as in e.g.\n\n(fn (x) (cons 'a x))\n\nthen (cdr body) will be false, so the expansion will be\n\n(list 'lit 'clo scope '(x) '(cons 'a x))\n\nIf we call fn with three or more arguments, meaning a parameter list\nplus two or more expressions, e.g.\n\n(fn (x)\n  (prn 'hello)\n  (cons 'a x))\n\nThen the expansion wraps a do around the expressions.\n\n(list 'lit 'clo scope '(x) '(do (prn 'hello) (cons 'a x)))\n\nWe haven't seen do yet, but it's coming soon. It makes multiple\nexpressions into a block of code.\n\nNext comes something unusual: vmark is set to a newly created pair\nmade by join. Missing arguments to primitives default to nil, so\n=(join) is equivalent to (join nil nil), and when you see a call like=\n=this, it's usually for the purpose of creating a fresh pair to mark=\n=the identity of something.=\n\n=Any pair with vmark in its car is treated by Bel as a variable.= The\n=next function, uvar, thus returns a new, unique variable each time=\nit's called. The reason we need such a thing is so that when we're\nmanipulating user code, we can add variables without worrying they'll\naccidentally share the names of variables created by users.\n\nNow we see the definition of do, which we used in the expansion of\nfn. The do macro uses nested function calls to represent blocks of\ncode.\n\nSuppose you want to evaluate two expressions in order and then return\nthe value of the last.\n\ne1\ne2\n\nYou can make this happen by embodying e2 in a function that you then\ncall on e1.\n\n((fn x e2) e1)\n\nWhen this expression is evaluated, e1 will be evaluated first, and\nits value passed to the function in the car of the call:\n\n(fn x e2)\n\nThen e2 will be evaluated, ignoring the value of e1 passed in the\nparameter, and its value returned. Result: e1 and then e2 get\nevaluated, as if in a block. (You cannot of course safely use x as\nthe parameter in case it occurs within e2, but I'll explain how to\ndeal with that in a minute.)\n\nThis technique generalizes to blocks of any size. Here's one with 3\nexpressions:\n\n((fn x ((fn x e3) e2)) e1)\n\nYou can use reduce to generate this kind of expression as follows\n\n(def block args\n  (reduce (fn (x y)\n            (list (list 'fn 'x y) x))\n          args))\n\n> (block 'e1 'e2 'e3)\n((fn x ((fn x e3) e2)) e1)\n\nand this is almost exactly what the do macro does. If you look at\nits definition, it's almost identical to that of block.\n\nOne difference is that do is a macro rather than a function, which\nmeans that the nested call gets evaluated after it's generated.\n\nThe other difference is that we call uvar to make the parameter\ninstead of using x. We can't safely use any symbol as the parameter\nin case it occurs in one of the expressions in the do. Since we're\nnever going to look at the values passed in these function calls, we\ndon't care what parameter we use, so long as it's unique.\n\nIf you want to establish a lexical binding for some variable, you do\nit with let, which is a very simple macro upon fn.\n\n> (let x 'a\n    (cons x 'b))\n(a . b)\n\nSince let expands into a fn, you have the full power of Bel parameter\nlists in the first argument.\n\n> (let (x . y) '(a b c)\n    (list x y))\n(a (b c))\n\nThe macro macro is analogous to the fn macro in that it returns a\nliteral macro. You'll rarely use these directly, but you could if you\nwanted to.\n\n> ((macro (v) `(set ,v 'a)) x)\na\n> x\na\n\nNext we see the definition of def itself, which does nothing more\nthan set its first argument to a fn made using the rest of the\narguments, and also of mac, which does the same with macro.\n\n(I like it when I can define new operators as thin, almost trivial\nseeming layers on top of existing operators. It seems a sign of\northogonality.)\n\nIf you were wondering why fn needs two cases-- why we don't just\nalways wrap a do around the body-- the reason is that do calls\nreduce, which is defined using def, which expands into a fn. So to\navoid an infinite recursion we either have to define reduce as a\nliteral function, or make either fn or do consider the single\nexpression case, and making fn do it was the least ugly.\n\nNow that we have let, we can define or, which returns the first\nnon-nil value returned by one of its arguments. Like most ors in\nprogramming languages, it only evaluates as many arguments as it\nneeds to, which means you can use it for control flow as well as\nlogical disjunction.\n\n> (or 'a (prn 'hello))\na\n\nThe definition of or is the first recursive macro definition we've\nseen. Unless it has no arguments, an or will expand into another or.\nThis is fine so long as the recursion terminates, which this one\nwill because each time we look at the cdr of the list of arguments,\nwhich will eventually be nil. (Though you could spoof or by\nconstructing a circular list and applying or to it.)\n\nIn effect\n\n(or foo bar)\n\nexpands into\n\n(let x foo\n  (if x\n      x\n      (let y bar\n        (if y\n            y\n            nil))))\n\nexcept that we can't actually use variables like x and y to hold the\nvalues, and instead have to use uvars.\n\nNotice incidentally that the expression above could be optimized\n\n(let x foo\n  (if x\n      x\n      bar))\n\nbut the definition of or doesn't try to; like every definition in\nBel, its purpose is to define what or means, not to provide an\nefficient implementation of it.\n\n=In Bel, macros are applyable just like functions are, though if you=\n=do that you get only the logical aspect of or and not the control=\naspect, since in a call to apply the arguments have already all been\nevaluated.\n\n> (apply or '(nil nil))\nnil\n> (apply or '(nil a b))\na\n\nThe and macro is similar in spirit to or, but different in its\nimplementation. Whereas or uses recursion to generate its expansion,\nand uses reduce. Since\n\n(and w x y z)\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(if w (if x (if y z)))\n\nit's an obvious candidate for reduce.\n\nNotice the function given to reduce has a single parameter. A\nfunction given as the first argument to reduce will only ever be\ncalled with two arguments, so usually such a function will have a\nlist of two parameters, but in this case we just want to cons an if\nonto the front of the arguments each time.\n\nThe other interesting thing about and is what we do when it has no\narguments. While we want (or) to return nil, we want (and) to return\nt. So in the second argument to reduce, we replace an empty args with\n(t).\n\nThe next function, =, is the one that programs usually use to test\nfor equality. It returns true iff its arguments are trees of the same\nshape whose leaves are the same atoms.\n\n> (id '(a b) '(a b))\nnil\n> (= '(a b) '(a b))\nt\n\nIn Bel, everything that's not a symbol, character, or stream is a\npair. Numbers and strings are pairs, for example. So you'd never\nwant to use id for comparison unless you were specifically looking\nfor identical list structure.\n\nIn the definition of = we see the first instance of square bracket\nnotation.\n\n(all [id _ (car args)] (cdr args))\n\nThis is equivalent to\n\n(all (fn (x) (id x (car args)))\n     (cdr args))\n\nI.e., is everything in the cdr of args id to the car? You know you\ncan use id to test equality at this point, because if one of the args\nis an atom, they all have to be for them to be =, and you can use id\nto test equality of atoms.\n\nIf id took any number of arguments =(it doesn't, because I want axioms=\n=to be as weak as possible)=, the preceding all expression could have\nbeen simply\n\n(apply id args)\n\nThe next four functions are predicates for the four types. All use =\nfor this test even though all could use id. My rule is to use =\nunless I specifically need id. That way the appearance of id is a\nsignal that code is looking for identical structure.\n\nThen we see proper, which tells us whether something is a proper\nlist. Informally, a proper list is one that we don't need a dot to\ndisplay.\n\n> (proper nil)\nt\n> (proper '(a . b))\nnil\n> (proper '(a b))\nt\n\nFormally, something is a proper list if it's either nil or a pair\nwhose cdr is a proper list, which is exactly what the definition\nsays.\n\nIn Bel, a proper list of characters is called a string, and has a\nspecial notation: zero or more characters within double quotes.\n\n> (string \"foo\")\nt\n\nThe next function, mem, tests for list membership.\n\n> (mem 'b '(a b c))\n(b c)\n> (mem 'e '(a b c))\nnil\n> (mem \\a \"foobar\")\n\"ar\"\n\nSince it uses some, it returns the rest of the list starting with the\nthing we're looking for, rather than simply t.\n\nIn the definition of mem we see the first use of an optional\nparameter. If in a parameter list you see a list beginning with the\nsymbol o, then the parameter following the o is an optional one. It\ncan be followed by an expression, and if no value is supplied for the\nparameter in the call, it gets the value of that expression instead\n(or nil if there isn't one). So\n\n> ((fn (x (o y)) y) 'a)\nnil\n> ((fn (x (o y 'b)) y) 'a)\nb\n\nThe optional parameter doesn't have to be a single symbol; it can be\na full parameter list. An example will be easier to understand if we\nuse let:\n\n> (let (x (o (y . z) '(a . b))) '(f)\n    (list x y z))\n(f a b)\n\nIn the definition of mem, the optional parameter is a comparison\nfunction, which defaults, as such functions usually will, to =.\nBy supplying different comparison functions we can get different\nbehaviors out of mem.\n\n> (mem 3 '(2 4 6 8) >)\n(4 6 8)\n\nThe next function, in, is effectively a generalization of =. It\nreturns true iff its first argument is = to any of the rest.\n\nThen come three common combinations of car and cdr: cadr, which gets\nthe second element of a list, cddr, which takes two elements off the\nfront, and caddr, which gets the third element. We'll have other ways\nto do these things once we've defined numbers.\n\nThe case macro takes an initial expression e, followed by\nalternating keys (which are implicitly quoted) and expressions, and\nreturns the result of evaluating the expression following the key\nthat's = to the value of e.\n\nIf case is given an even number of arguments, the last one is the\ndefault. Otherwise the default is nil.\n\nE.g. this function\n\n(def sname (s)\n  (case s\n    + 'plus\n    - 'minus\n      'unknown))\n\nreturns the name of a sign represented by a symbol:\n\n> (sname '+)\nplus\n\nThe iflet macro lets you use the result of a test in an if. It works\nlike an ordinary if, except that it takes an initial variable, which\nin any then expression will be lexically bound to the value returned\nby the preceding test expression.\n\n> (iflet x nil      'foo\n           '(a b c) (car x)\n                    'bar)\na\n\nNotice how similar the definitions of case and iflet are, despite\ntheir different purposes. They're both recursive macros, like or,\nand both work through their arguments two at a time.\n\nWe use iflet to define aif, which implicitly binds the variable it\nto the value of the preceding test expression.\n\n> (map (fn (x)\n         (aif (cdr x) (car it)))\n       '((a) (b c) (d e f) (g)))\n(nil c e nil)\n\nThe function given to map here tests whether x has a non-nil cdr,\nand if so returns the car of it.\n\nWith aif and some, it's trivial to define find, which returns the\nfirst element of a list that matches some test.\n\n> (find [= (car _) \\a]\n        '(\"pear\" \"apple\" \"grape\"))\n\"apple\"\n\nThe begins function returns true iff its first argument is a list\nthat begins with its second argument:\n\n> (begins '(a b c d e) '(a b))\nt\n\nLike mem, it takes an optional comparison function that defaults\nto =.\n\nIt's used in caris, which returns true iff its first argument is a\npair whose car is its second.\n\n> (caris '(a b) 'a)\nt\n\nThis is one of those functions you end up using surprisingly often,\nbecause it's so common for the car of a list to have some special\nsignificance.\n\nOur next function, hug, applies a function to pairs of elements of a\nlist. Since the default function is list, by default it simply\nreturns pairs of elements.\n\n> (hug '(a b c d e))\n((a b) (c d) (e))\n> (hug '(1 2 3 4 5) +)\n(3 7 5)\n\nThis too is something you need surprisingly often, especially when\noperating on expressions, where it's common to have subexpressions\nthat form implicit pairs. We've seen this already in if, case, and\niflet, and we see it implemented with hug in the next macro, with,\nwhich is a multi-variable let.\n\n> (with (x 'a\n         y 'b)\n    (cons x y))\n(a . b)\n\nIt binds the variables in parallel in the sense that the bindings of\nprevious variables are not visible in the expressions defining the\nvalues of later ones.\n\n> (let x 'a\n    (with (x 'b\n           y x)\n      y))\na\n\nThe next function, keep, returns all the elements of a list that pass\nsome test\n\n> (keep odd '(1 2 3 4 5))\n(1 3 5)\n\nand rem removes its first argument from a list\n\n> (rem \\a \"abracadabra\")\n\"brcdbr\"\n\nor more precisely, since it takes an optional comparison function f,\nall the elements of the list that fail [f _ x], where x is the first\nargument.\n\n> (rem 4 '(5 3 1 2 4) >=)\n(3 1 2)\n\nThe next two functions, get and put, are for operating on key-value\nstores represented as lists of pairs like this one:\n\n> (set x '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))\n((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))\n\nThe first, get, retrieves entries,\n\n> (get 'a x)\n(a . 1)\n> (get 'z x)\nnil\n\nand the second, put, creates them.\n\n> (put 'z 26 x)\n((z . 26) (a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))\n> (put 'a 9 x)\n((a . 9) (b . 2) (c . 3))\n\nThe reason get returns the whole pair instead of just the associated\nvalue is so that we can distinguish between a key having a value of\nnil and having no value.\n\nNotice that put doesn't change the value of x, just as consing\nsomething onto x wouldn't change the value of it.\n\nThe function rev reverses a list,\n\n> (rev \"able\")\n\"elba\"\n\nand snap breaks off a piece of its second argument that's as long as\nits first, returning both parts:\n\n> (snap '(a b) '(1 2 3 4 5))\n((1 2) (3 4 5))\n\nIt's used in udrop (for \"unary drop\"), which returns just the\nremaining part:\n\n> (udrop '(a b) '(1 2 3 4 5))\n(3 4 5)\n\nThen we get the identity function, idfn:\n\n> (map idfn '(a b c))\n(a b c)\n\nYou wouldn't call this directly (why bother?) but you often end up\nusing it as a default or when operating on functions.\n\nThe function is is a little unusual in that it returns a function for\ncomparing its argument to something.\n\n> ((is 'a) 'a)\nt\n\nAn is is a partially applied =, so in principle we won't need it\nafter we define partial application later on. But this case is so\ncommon that it's convenient to have a separate operator for it.\n\nNow come several macros for dealing with errors. The first, eif,\nintroduces several new concepts, so I'll explain them first, then eif\nitself.\n\nOne thing we see being used for the first time here is dynamic\nbinding. To show how it works, we'll define a function that refers to\na variable with no global value:\n\n(def foo ()\n  snerg)\n\nIf we call foo normally, we'll get an error saying snerg has no\nvalue. But if we call foo within a dyn expression that creates a\ndynamic binding for snerg, it will work:\n\n> (dyn snerg 'a\n    (foo))\na\n\nWe couldn't get the same result by saying\n\n(let snerg 'a\n  (foo))\n\nbecause a lexical binding created by let (or more precisely by a\nfunction call) is only visible within its body. And whereas lexical\nbindings get saved in closures (as in e.g. is), dynamic bindings,\nlike global ones, don't.\n\nAnother concept we're seeing for the first time is that of a\ncontinuation. A continuation is basically a computation in the middle\nof happening. (Or more prosaically, it's a copy of the stack.) A\ncontinuation is callable, like a function, and if you call one, you\nrestart the computation where it was created.\n\nYou can get your hands on the current continuation by calling the ccc\nspecial form with a function of one argument. It will be the current\ncontinuation, which you can then save. Let's try making one.\n\nHere's some simple code that makes a list:\n\n> (list 'a 'b)\n(a b)\n\nNow let's try replacing the 'b with an expression that saves the\ncurrent continuation before returning b:\n\n> (list 'a (ccc (fn (c)\n                  (set cont c)\n                  'b)))\n(a b)\n\nIt returns the same value, but in the process we've set cont to the\ncontinuation at the point where the ccc occurred. If we call cont\nwith some value, our old computation will be restarted as if that\nvalue had been returned by the ccc expression:\n\n> (cont 'z)\n(a z)\n\nContinuations work any number of times:\n\n> (cont 'w)\n(a w)\n\nOne thing we can use continuations for is aborting computations. If\nwe save a continuation before starting something, then by calling the\ncontinuation we can escape from the middle of it.\n\n> (ccc (fn (c)\n         (dyn abort c\n           (do (abort 'a)\n               (car 'b)))))\na\n\nHere we bind abort to the continuation before we start evaluating the\ndo expression. The second expression within the do\n\n(car 'b)\n\nwould cause an error if it were evaluated. But we never get to it,\nbecause we call abort first.\n\nWhen an error occurs, err is called on a value representing the\nerror. So if the variable that we dynamically bind is err instead of\nabort, we can take over what happens when an error is signalled.\n\nHere we rebind err to return hello when an error occurs:\n\n> (ccc (fn (c)\n         (dyn err (fn (x) (c 'hello))\n           (car 'b))))\nhello\n\nThis time the car expression does get evaluated, which causes an\nerror to be signalled. But by establishing a dynamic binding for\nerr, we've ensured that it's our function that gets called when the\nerror is signalled. And our function simply returns hello from the\nccc expression.\n\nYou can probably imagine how you'd write a macro to evaluate an\nexpression in an error-proof way: just make the expansion put the\nexpression within something like\n\n(ccc (fn (c)\n       (dyn err (fn (x) (c nil))\n         expression)))\n\nexcept of course you'd want to use a uvar instead of c.\n\nNow let's look at eif. It's like if except that which of its\narguments get evaluated depends not on whether its test expression\nreturns true, but whether it causes an error.\n\n> (eif x (car 'a)\n         'oops\n         x)\noops\n> (eif x (car '(a b))\n         'oops\n         x)\na\n\nThe variable before the test expression (in this case x) will be\nlexically bound either to the value returned by the test expression,\nor to whatever err was called with if an error occurred.\n\nThe expansion of the first eif above looks like\n\n(let v (join)\n  (let w (ccc (fn (c)\n                (dyn err [c (cons v _)] (car 'a))))\n    (if (caris w v id)\n        (let x (cdr w) 'oops)\n        (let x w x))))\n\nexcept of course v, w, and c will be uvars. When we look at the code\nabove, we can see how eif tells whether the value it got back from\nthe test expression represents an error or not. The variable v is\nbound to a newly created pair. Within the continuation, err is bound\nto a function that returns v consed onto whatever err was called\nwith. So to decide which of the two succeeding expressions to\nevaluate, we just check whether the car of w is v. (And of course we\ncheck using id, not =.)\n\nThe eif macro is the most general error-catching macro, but there\nare two more, onerr and safe, that are more commonly used. The\nonerr macro takes two expressions and returns the value of the first\nif the second causes an error:\n\n> (onerr 'oops (car 'a))\noops\n\nand the safe macro simply returns nil if the expression within\nit causes an error:\n\n> (safe (car '(a b)))\na\n> (safe (car 'a))\nnil\n\nThe next function, literal, returns true iff its argument evaluates\nto itself,\n\n> (map literal (list nil \"foo\" car))\n(t t t)\n\nwhile variable returns true iff its argument is a variable, meaning\nan ordinary symbol or a uvar:\n\n> (map variable (list 'x (uvar) t))\n(t t nil)\n\nAnd isa is for checking whether something is a particular kind of\nlit. Like is, isa doesn't do the check, but returns a function that\ndoes\n\n> ((isa 'clo) map)\nt\n\nThe operators we've defined so far, together with the axioms, will\nnow enable us to define a function that acts as a Bel interpreter: a\nfunction that will take any Bel expression as an argument and\nevaluate it.\n\n(We don't need all the operators we've defined so far to define a Bel\ninterpreter. These are, rather, the minimum set we need to define an\ninterpreter in a way that's not too ugly.)\n\nMuch of the code in the interpreter operates on the same set of\nstructures, and these always have the same parameter names.\n\nEach thread is a list\n\n(s r)\n\nof two stacks: a stack s of expressions to be evaluated, and a stack\nr of return values.\n\nEach element of s is in turn a list\n\n(e a)\n\nwhere e is an expression to be evaluated, and a is a lexical\nenvironment consisting of a list of (var . val) pairs.\n\nThe variable p holds a list of all the threads (usually other than\nthe current one).\n\nThe other thing we need to pass around in the interpreter is the\nglobal bindings, which is another environment represented as a list\nof (var . val) pairs. I use the variable g for this.\n\nThe most common parameter list we'll see is\n\n(s r m)\n\nwhere s is the current expression stack, r is the current return\nvalue stack, and m is a list (p g) of the other threads and the\nglobal bindings.\n\nThe interpreter itself begins with the function bel, which takes an\nexpression e and starts the interpreter running with a single thread\nin which e is to be evaluated. The arguments it sends to ev represent\nthe usual (s r m) triple. So\n\n(list (list e nil))\n\nis an expression stack containing nothing except e, to be evaluated\nin a null environment. The second argument, nil, is the return value\nstack, which is empty because we're not returning from anything. And\nthe third argument is m, aka (p g), a list of the other threads\n(currently nil) and an environment to use as the global bindings.\n\nIf we jump ahead a few definitions to ev, we come to the core of the\ninterpreter. This function plays the role eval did in McCarthy's\nLisp. Its parameters implicitly pull an (e a) expression-environment\npair off the expression stack. There are only five things the\nexpression can be:\n\n1. A literal, in which case we return it.\n\n2. A variable, in which case we call vref to look up its value.\n\n3. An improper list, in which case we signal an error.\n\n4. A list beginning with a special form, in which case we call the\n   associated function stored in forms.\n\n5. An ordinary call, in which case we call evcall on it.\n\nI'm going to follow the trail of evaluating a literal to explain some\nthings about how evaluation works, then come back and examine the\nother cases.\n\nOne of the most important things to understand about the\ninterpreter is that it never returns a value till it terminates.\nThe way it implements returning a value in the program it's\nevaluating is not by returning a value itself, but by a recursive\ncall to the interpreter with a shorter expression stack and the\nreturn value consed onto the return stack. And that's what we see\nhappening in the code that runs when e is a literal:\n\n(mev s (cons e r) m)\n\nThat is what returning a value looks like.\n\nThe function mev (m = multi-threaded) is what the interpreter calls\nto continue evaluation after doing something. Its purpose is to check\nwhether interpretation should terminate, and if not, to allow another\nthread to run.\n\nThe first thing mev does is check if the current thread has run out\nof work to do. If so, if s is nil, it checks whether there are other\nthreads in p. If there are, it calls sched to run one. If not, if\nthis is the only thread and we've just finished it, then it returns\nwhatever's on top of the return value stack as the value of calling\nthe interpreter.\n\nIf we haven't finished the current expression stack, then we have to\ncheck whether we should stay in this thread or switch to another one.\nOrdinarily you want to give other threads a chance to run, but\nsometimes you can't, if you're doing something that requires multiple\nsteps to complete, and in the middle is in an inconsistent state.\n\nThe way a program signals that it doesn't want to be interrupted is\nby dynamically binding lock to a non-nil value. If lock is on, we put\nthe current thread on the front of the list of threads, and if not we\nput it on the end. Since sched always runs the first thread on the\nlist, if we keep the current thread on the front, it keeps running.\n\nNow that we've seen how mev and sched work, let's return to ev. If e\nis a variable, we call vref to evaluate it. And what vref ordinarily\ndoes is this:\n\n(aif (lookup v a s g)\n     (mev s (cons (cdr it) r) m)\n     (sigerr 'unbound s r m))\n\nYou may now recognize that kind of call to mev: that's returning a\nvalue. If the lookup succeeds, it returns the (var . val) pair it\nfound, so the value is the cdr of it. If lookup fails, it returns\nnil, in which case we've just encountered a reference to an unbound\nvariable, and we should signal an error.\n\nLet's skip down to lookup and see what it does. It checks, in order,\nwhether the variable has a dynamic binding, a lexical binding, or a\nglobal binding. At the end there are special cases for the two\nvariables globe and scope; for them the interpreter simply \"leaks\"\nthe corresponding parameter. Leak is an apt metaphor in this\nsituation because data is going from one layer of Bel to another:\nfrom the interpreter running in Bel to the Bel program it's\nevaluating.\n\nWe use binding to check whether a variable has a dynamic binding. It\nchecks by searching the expression stack looking for an entry binding\nthat variable. As we'll see when we get to its definition, dyn works\nby inserting a special entry on the expression stack listing the\nvariable it wants to bind and its value. There are other operators\nthat insert special entries on the expression stack too. These\nentries are distinguishable from ordinary expressions by beginning\nwith a pair called smark.\n\nWhile we're here, let's look at sigerr. This is how the interpreter\nsignals an error. As we saw earlier in the examples of continuations,\nit begins by looking for a dynamic binding for err, and if there is\none, it calls it using applyf, which we'll get to later. If there\nisn't a binding for err, then there's an error in the interpreter\nitself, and we call err about it.\n\nThis sort of code where things happen at two different levels--\nthe Bel instance running the interpreter, and the Bel program that\nthe interpreter is evaluating-- is inevitably a bit confusing, but\nthat comes with the territory when a language is written in itself.\nFor errors, at least, there is a simple rule of thumb: when there's\nan error in a program you're evaluating, you call sigerr, and when\nthere's an error in yourself, you call err.\n\nCalling sigerr is like a parent reporting that the baby is crying.\nCalling err is crying oneself.\n\nBut what about the first half of vref, the one in which (inwhere s)\nreturns true? This code is for handling assignments. In Bel, any\nvalue that lives in a pair can be assigned using set. For example,\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (set (cadr x) 'z)\n    x)\n(a z c)\n\nThis code in vref is what makes it happen. It works as follows. When\nwe're in a set, another special entry (beginning as usual with smark)\nis put on the stack saying that we're not looking for the value of\nsomething, but its location. The function inwhere checks for one of\nthese, and if it finds one, we return not the value we're looking up,\nbut the pair it occurs in, plus either a or d to say whether it's in\nthe car or the cdr.\n\nNew global variables are created implicitly by assigning values to\nthem, and this is where that happens. The special stack entry found\nby inwhere says whether a new global binding should be created (it\nshould be for set, but not for push for example) and if it should, we\ncreate a new pair to hold its name and value, and splice it into the\nglobal variables.\n\nNotice that in this case the first argument to mev, at the end, is\n(cdr s) rather than s. We're discarding the special stack entry found\nby inwhere.\n\nIncidentally, this is a case where we need lock, because when this\nnew binding is created, the value is nil initially. So if code in\nanother thread looked up this variable, there would be a window\nduring which it seemed to have the value nil. The code that handles\nlocking is in the definition of set, which we'll see later.\n\nNow back up to ev. The next case is when e isn't a proper list. We\nknow by this point that e not an atom, because every atom is either a\nliteral or a variable. So e must be a list, but we have to make sure\nit's a proper one. If it isn't we call sigerr.\n\nBy the next line we know that e is a nonempty proper list. So the\nnext question is, is the first element a special form?  The variable\nforms is a list of (name . function) pairs telling the interpreter\nwhat to do when it encounters an expression beginning with name.\n\nThe first of these is smark, the pair we created for marking stack\nentries that are not just ordinary expressions. The initial value of\nforms\n\n(set forms (list (cons smark evmark)))\n\nmeans that when the expression we've just taken off the stack\nbegins with smark, we should call evmark. And in the definition of\nevmark we see the four types of stack entries we use smark for, each\nindicated by the symbol that comes after smark in the expression we\nput on the stack.\n\nOne of these, bind, we've already talked about. This is what dyn puts\non the stack to establish a dynamic binding. When we return back\nthrough one, all that should happen is that the dynamic binding\nceases to exist. The bind entry itself is a no-op; we just call\n(mev s r m) and get on with things.\n\nWe're also familiar with the idea of a loc entry; that's what we were\njust looking for in inwhere. We made a point of removing it from the\nstack once we'd found it. So if we return up through a loc entry,\nthat means we were unable to find a pair to modify, and we should\nsignal an error. E.g.\n\n> (set \\a 5)\nError: unfindable\n\nA fut (future) stack entry contains a closure to be called on\n(s r m). The interpreter inserts these when it needs to do\nsomething in several steps. This happens so often that there's a\nspecial fu macro (the resemblance to fn is intentional) for creating\nthese closures.\n\nThere's one of them in the prot clause of evcall. A prot (protect)\nstack entry means that an expression should be evaluated even when\ncalling a continuation throws control back over it. You'd use this\nfor example to make sure a file you opened eventually got closed.\nSince these protected expressions aren't supposed to return values,\nthe code for evaluating them includes a fu for throwing away the\nvalue that gets put onto the return value stack after the expression\nis evaluated: all this fu does it turn a call of the form (mev s r m)\ninto (mev s (cdr r) m). We'll learn more about protected expressions\nwhen we get to the code for creating them.\n\nThe rest of the special forms are defined using the form macro, which\nruns its arguments through formfn and then puts the result in an\nentry in forms. Let's start by looking at an example of a special\nform defined with it. The first is the definition of quote, which is\nabout as simple as a special form can get. The first parameter, (e),\nis the parameter list of the form as it will be called. So (e) means\nthat quote will take exactly one argument. We call it e, for\nexpression, because it won't have been evaluated. The remaining\narguments, a s r m, represent the lexical environment plus the usual\ns r m state of the world.\n\nThe body of the form is a familiar type of call to mev, representing\na return. So this definition says that quote takes one argument, e,\nand returns it unevaluated.\n\nThe definition of quote will be transformed by formfn into the\nequivalent of\n\n(fn v\n  (eif w (apply (fn (e) (list e))\n                (car v))\n         (apply sigerr 'bad-form (cddr v))\n         (let (e) w\n           (let (a s r m) (cdr v)\n             (mev s (cons e r) m)))))\n\nThe test expression in the eif accumulates all the form's parameters.\nIf an error occurs while doing that, we signal an error. (We know\n(cddr v) will be the familiar (s r m).) Otherwise we bind the\nparameters and evaluate the body of the form.\n\nThe reason we do this in two parts is in case someone calls the form\nwith the wrong arguments. If you're using form to define a form, you\ncan (and must) catch all other errors yourself, but you can't catch\nthat one. At least not short of using a single parameter to hold all\nthe arguments, and then teasing them out manually. Since that would\nmake form definitions ugly, the form macro does it for you.\n\n> (quote a b)\nError: bad-form\n\nNext comes the definition of if. Unlike quote, if does several\nthings, and when we do several things in a form, we don't just\nevaluate a block of code; we put the things we need to do on the\nstack and call mev.\n\nIn the base case, if the if has no arguments, we just return nil,\nusing the familiar formula. Otherwise we want to evaluate the first\nargument and then, if there are more arguments, evaluate the\nappropriate one depending on the value of the first. Which is\nbasically the code translated into English. Putting\n\n(list (car es) a)\n\non the stack is \"evaluate the first argument,\" and the conditional\nthat puts a closure that calls if2 on the stack, but only if (cdr es)\nis true, is \"if there are more arguments, evaluate the appropriate\none.\"\n\nNotice that if2 is just an ordinary function, not a form. It handles\nthe second part of evaluating an if, the choice of which subsequent\nexpression to evaluate depending on the value returned by the first.\n\nIf the value on top of the return stack is true, then the test\nexpression returned true, and the whole if returns the value of the\nsucceeding expression, so we just put (car es) onto the stack and go.\n\nBut if the first expression returned nil, we need to keep going.\nIf we're evaluating\n\n(if a b c d e)\n\nand a returns nil, then the value of the if expression is the value\nof\n\n(if c d e)\n\nand that is exactly what if2 is doing when it puts\n\n(cons 'if (cdr es))\n\non the stack. So the if form is recursive in the sense that it can\ncause another if expression to end up on the stack, where it will of\ncourse be handled by the if form.\n\nRegardless of what we put on the stack in if2, we need to discard\nthe value returned by the test expression, which is why the second\nargument to mev in if2 is (cdr r).\n\nThe if in if2 is where conditionalness (for lack of a better word)\ngets \"leaked\" from the Bel in which the interpreter is running to the\nBel program that the interpreter is evaluating.\n\nThe next form, where, is the one that creates the stack entries that\ninwhere looks for. It takes an expression e followed by an optional\nargument saying whether to create a new binding for a variable if\nthere isn't one already. It asks for e to be evaluated by putting\nthe conventional\n\n(list e a)\n\non the stack. But also, adjacent to this, it puts a special loc entry\non the stack saying that what we want when evaluating e is its\nlocation, not its value. This will be seen by inwhere in functions\nlike vref and handled accordingly.\n\n> (let x 'a\n    (where x))\n((x . a) d)\n\nThis return value is a list of the actual lexical binding created by\nthat let, plus a d indicating that the value in question is in the\ncdr of the pair. It's hard to imagine a reason to call where in\nordinary code; you use it in macros like set that modify things.\n\nNotice incidentally that the second, optional argument to where isn't\nevaluated. It's inserted directly into the loc entry built by where.\n\nAfter where, we see another form we're somewhat familiar with: dyn,\nwhich establishes dynamic bindings. This definition is like that of\nif in the sense that there's a function, dyn2, that does the second\nhalf of the work. The first half is to put the first expression, e1\non the stack to get it evaluated. Its value will be what we bind the\nvariable to.\n\nIn dyn2 we see this binding being created, in the form of a stack\nentry being put on the stack. We also ask for the evaluation of the\nsecond expression, and we put that request, (e2 a), in front of the\nbind entry. If we see a reference to v during the evaluation of e2,\nthe bind entry will be sitting on the stack to tell us it has a\ndynamic binding.\n\nNotice that the payload of the bind entry will be a (var . val)\npair of the familiar form, just like we find in lexical and global\nenvironments. This is not a coincidence. It means the code that sets\nglobal or lexical variables also sets dynamic bindings; in fact, the\ncode doesn't even know which type it's operating on; all it knows is\nthat it's doing something to the cdr of a pair.\n\n> (dyn x 'a\n    (do (set x 'b)\n        x))\nb\n\nThis wasn't a deliberate design choice. Like many other aspects of\nBel, it's just a consequence of making the interpreter as simple as\npossible. I tried to let simplicity make as many decisions for me as\nI could.\n\nLike where and dyn, after works by putting a special entry on the\nstack-- this time a prot entry. We saw what a prot entry means when\nexamining evmark. All the after form does is create the prot entry;\nthe real work happens elsewhere.\n\nThe ccc form creates a continuation, or more precisely generates\ncode that calls a function on a continuation. A continuation itself\nis a simple thing-- basically just s and r, which between them are a\ncomplete representation of the state of the current thread.\n\nFinally, the thread form takes an expression and starts evaluating it\nin a new thread. Unusually, nearly all the work is in the last\nargument to mev, where we build new expression and return value\nstacks much as we did up in bel. The second argument (cons nil r)\nmeans the thread expression itself returns nil in the thread in which\nit occurs.\n\nAlong with lit and apply, those seven operators-- quote, if, where,\ndyn, after, ccc, and thread-- are all the special forms. But if you\nneed more you can easily define them with form.\n\nNow we come to the code that handles the last case in ev, an ordinary\ncall. Its definition looks a lot like the code we saw in the forms.\nAll the code in the interpreter is either calls to mev or to things\nthat call mev. By now we're used to reading this sort of thing:\nevcall puts the car of the expression on the stack to be evaluated,\nplus a closure that calls evcall2 to do the rest of the work.\n\nThe rest of the work, as we see in evcall2, begins with checking\nwhether the value of the car of the expression is a macro. If it is,\nwe call applym. If it isn't, we know we can evaluate the arguments,\nso we put them all on the expression stack, along with a closure that\nwill snap the corresponding number of values off the top of the\nreturn stack, and then send them plus the operator to applyf.\n\nWhen we look at applym, we see that the evaluation of a macro call\nalso goes through applyf, but with different arguments. We apply the\nfunction within the macro, (caddr mac), to the unevaluated arguments,\nargs. This generates the macroexpansion. But the macroexpansion then\nhas to be evaluated, and that's the purpose of this closure we put on\nthe stack:\n\n(fu (s r m)\n  (mev (cons (list (car r) a) s)\n       (cdr r)\n       m)\n\nThe (car r) within it is a sign of something unusual happening: we're\nmoving something (the macroexpansion) from the return value stack to\nthe expression stack.\n\nThere's a slight surprise waiting in applyf: the apply special form\nis implemented as a clause here. What it does is pretty simple: apply\nis a recursive call to applyf with the arguments joined together. The\nnext case is the general one, when f is a lit, and in that case we\ncall applylit.\n\nFunctions aren't the only thing you can apply in Bel. You can apply\nanything if you define a way to do it. We haven't gotten to this yet,\nbut numbers for example return the corresponding element of a list:\n\n> (3 '(a b c d))\nc\n\nSuch expressions are also settable:\n\n> (let x '(a b c d)\n    (set (3 x) 'z)\n    x)\n(a b z d)\n\nSince the thing we're about to apply might be a settable reference,\nthe first thing we need to check in applyprim is whether we're in\na where, just as we do when looking up the value of a variable. If we\nare, then we look in a list called locfns to see if there's one that\nmatches, and if so we call the corresponding function on the function\nand its arguments.\n\nLet's skip down to the locs defined after applyprim to see some of\nthese. The loc operator defines new locfns, and after its definition\nwe see the loc for car. Or more precisely, a loc whose test will\nmatch the symbol car; the keys of locs are predicates, not symbols.\n\nWe don't need many locs; knowing how to set the car or cdr of a pair\nwill handle most cases. When we look at the loc for car, it's pretty\nsimple: it just \"returns\" (by consing onto the return stack) a list\nof the argument and an a, to indicate we're looking in the car.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (where (car x)))\n((a b c) a)\n\nThe loc for cdr is similarly simple.\n\nAfter the inwhere check, we see cases for the four predefined\napplyable things in Bel: primitives, closures, macros, and\ncontinuations.\n\nTo apply a primitive, we call applyprim. Let's skip down to it and\nsee what it does. The first thing applyprim does is look the prim up\nin a list of prims to see if it really is one. If you're wondering\nwhy prims is organized the way it is, the primitives are grouped by\nthe maximum number of arguments they take. This is frankly a trick to\nget around not having numbers yet; we can use udrop with the position\nof the prim in prims to detect calls with too many arguments.\n\nSince primitives can take at most two arguments, we pick out two,\nwhich we call a and b. Since car and cdr of nil both yield nil, this\nis how we make missing arguments to primitives default to nil.\n\n> (join)\n(nil)\n\nIf the call is a legal one, we call the primitive with the same name.\nThis is another place where behavior leaks from the instance of Bel\nin which the interpreter is running to the code it's evaluating: when\nthe interpreter sees a call to car in the code it's evaluating, the\ninterpreter calls car itself.\n\nThe primitive might signal an error, if for example we call car on an\natom. So the case expression containing the calls to the primitives\nis wrapped in an eif, and if there's an error, we leak the same\nerror object (whose nature is unspecified) up into the program we're\nevaluating. Otherwise we just \"return\" whatever the call returns, by\nconsing it onto the return stack.\n\nSince primitives are one of the cases where it's most confusing to\nhave things happening at two levels, I want to be as clear as\npossible about how they work. The interpreter can call car. That's\ntrue by assumption. Up in the program being evaluated, we want car to\nhave a value. So we give it a sort of placeholder value, the list\n(lit prim car), which means, in effect, \"please call car for me,\ninterpreter,\" which the interpreter does whenever it encounters one\nof these placeholders being called like a function.\n\nNow back up to applylit. The next clause handles all the functions\nthat aren't prims, and it's implemented by calling applyclo. But\nsince functions are just lists and there's nothing to stop someone\nfrom trying to call an ill-formed clo, we have to check the validity\nof every component of this supposed closure first.\n\nIf it checks out, we send it and the arguments to applyclo. This\nfunction does two things, in the sense of putting two things on the\nexpression stack. The first fu on the stack calls pass to get a\nlexical environment representing the parameter bindings onto the top\nof the return stack, and the second simply puts the body of the\nfunction (which is a single expression) on the stack, with those\nbindings as its environment.\n\nThe real work is done by pass and its subroutines typecheck and\ndestructure. Between them these take a parameter list and a list of\narguments, and turn them into an environment consisting of\n(var . val) pairs.\n\nBefore we look at them I should explain a feature of Bel parameter\nlists that we haven't encountered yet: type checking. A parameter of\nthe form\n\n(t v f)\n\nmeans that unless f is true of the value passed to v, an error will\nbe signalled. So if we define\n\n(def consa ((t xs pair))\n  (cons 'a xs))\n\nand we call it with an argument that's not a pair, we'll get an\nerror:\n\n> (consa 'z)\nError: mistype\n\nIf the variable and test in a t parameter are symbols, you can simply\nconjoin them with a vertical bar.\n\n(def consa (xs|pair)\n  (cons 'a xs))\n\nThe reader expands x|y into (t x y).\n\nYou can nest t parameters, o parameters, and parameters that are\npairs without restriction.\n\n(def foo ((o (t (x . y) [caris _ 'a]) '(a . b)))\n  x)\n\n> (foo '(b b))\nError: mistype\n> (foo)\na\n\nThough as you can see, programs get hard to read if you do too much\ncomputation in the parameter list.\n\nThe way pass works is by descending depth-first through the\nparameter list, trying to match it up with the arguments. It takes\nsix arguments. The last three are the familiar (s r m), and the\nfirst three represent a part of the parameter list, the\ncorresponding part of the argument list, and the environment we've\naccumulated so far.\n\nThe reason we have to give pass (s r m) as well is that the work it\ndoes can't be done as a simple subroutine. It's not simply matching\nparameters and arguments. The default expressions for optional\nparameters mean we're really running the interpreter when we call\npass. And pass doesn't return the result of matching parameters with\narguments, but rather ensures that one ends up on the top of the\nreturn value stack. (In other words, it causes a value to be returned\nin the Bel program that the interpreter is evaluating, rather than\nreturning a value within the Bel instance in which the interpreter is\nrunning.)\n\nIt starts by defining a local function, ret, that returns a value in\nthe sense of calling mev with the new value consed onto the return\nstack. Then we have a bunch of cases to consider. If there are no\nparameters left, then we check whether there are any arguments left.\nIf there are, the function has been called with too many arguments,\nand we should signal an error; if there aren't, then we've finished,\nand we can put the environment we've built onto the return stack.\n\nIf we get past that test, we know pat, the parameter or parameters,\nis non-nil. Is it a literal? If so that's an error, because you\ncan't use a literal (other than nil) as a parameter. Whereas if it's\na variable, we can just add a new (var . val) pair of it and whatever\nthe arguments are to the env we've built so far, and \"return\" it\nusing ret.\n\nSince literal and variable between them cover all atoms, if we get\npast these tests we know pat must be a pair, so there are three\npossibilities left: that's it's a t parameter, that it's an o\nparameter, or that it's an ordinary list.\n\nIf it's a t parameter, we call typecheck, and what that does is put a\ncall to the test function on the expression stack, followed by a\nclosure that checks whether that call returned true, and if so\nrecursively calls pass with the var stripped of the type check.\nOtherwise it signals an error.\n\nWhereas if pat is an optional parameter, since we know we have a\nvalue for it (whatever arg is), we can ignore the default expression\nand call pass recursively as if it were an ordinary parameter.\n\nHow do we know we have a value for pat? What if arg is nil? This\nis not the point where we check whether we've run out of arguments.\nIf arg is nil at this point, that means the value being passed as an\nargument is nil, not that there are no arguments.\n\nIn the final case in pass, the parameter is a list, and we need to\ncall destructure to go inside it and the arguments to see if they\nmatch. When you call a function with a parameter list (rather than a\nparameter like args that's a single variable), this is the case you\ngo through the first time through pass.\n\nThis is where you notice if you've run out of arguments, and that is\nthe first thing destructure checks. If the first parameter is an\noptional parameter, you're ok so far, because you can evaluate its\ndefault expression to get a value for it. In that case put the\ndefault expression on the stack, followed by a pair of closures that\nin effect do a depth-first traversal of the parameter list, one\ncalling pass on the first parameter (with the value returned by the\ndefault expression as the \"argument\"), and a second calling pass on\nthe remaining parameters, with nil as the argument, since we already\nknow it's empty.\n\nIf arg is nil and the first parameter in our list isn't an optional\none, then we know the function was called with too few arguments,\nand we signal an error.\n\n> ((fn (x y) x) 'a)\nError: underargs\n\nThe other error case is when arg is a non-nil atom. We can match such\nan argument with a single parameter, but not with a list of\nparameters. So if arg is an atom, we signal an error.\n\n> ((fn ((x y)) x) 'a)\nError: atom-arg\n\nThe default clause of destructure is the \"normal\" case where we have\na non-empty list of arguments. Here we also use mev to do a\ndepth-first traversal of the parameters, very much like the one we\nsaw in the first clause of destructure.\n\nThe fact that pass uses the environment it's in the process of\nbuilding as the environment when it puts expressions on the stack\nmeans the bindings of earlier parameters are visible to the code in\nlater ones:\n\n> ((fn (x (o y x)) y) 'a)\na\n> ((fn (f x|f) x) pair 'a)\nError: mistype\n\nNow to continue with our own depth-first traversal of the\ninterpreter, back up in applylit, which we're halfway through. The\nnext clause is for macros. The difference between applying a macro\nand an ordinary macro call is that when you apply an operator, the\narguments have already been evaluated. But you can generate a macro\ncall easily by consing the macro onto the front of a list of quoted\narguments. So you just call applym on that. (You could send it to\nmev, but you know it will end up in applym, so you might as well go\nstraight there.)\n\nThe next clause in applylit is for continuations. After checking the\nvalidity of a continuation, we call applycont to call it.\n\nIn the definition of ccc we saw that making a continuation is simple:\nit's just a list of s and r. The work is done when the continuation\nis called. But even then it's not that much work. If a continuation\nis\n\n(lit cont s2 r2)\n\nyou could call it on an argument a simply by saying\n\n(mev s2 (cons a r2) m)\n\nexcept for two things. One is that you have to check that the form of\nthe continuation is valid, just as you do with a closure. The other\nis that there may be prot entries in your current evaluation stack,\nand the whole point of prots is that those expressions get evaluated\neven if evaluation is interrupted before you reach them.\n\nSo you can't just use s2 as the first argument to mev. You have to\ncombine s2 with everything that you need to keep from your current\nexpression stack. That includes prots and also binds, since the code\nin a prot could refer to a dynamically bound variable.\n\nThose two possibilities account for all the complexity of calling\ncontinuations. Otherwise it would be one line in applylit.\n\nFinally, in the last clause of applylit, we see the code that makes\nit possible, for example, to use a number in functional position:\n\n> (2 '(a b c))\nb\n\nThe variable virfns (for virtual functions) is a list of (n . f)\npairs where n is a type of lit and f is a function that generates an\nexpression to be evaluated when such a lit is encountered in\nfunctional position. Since these functions generate expressions,\nthey're a lot like macros.\n\nAlthough we haven't introduced numbers yet, here's the virtual\nfunction for them, so you can see what one looks like:\n\n(vir num (f args)\n  `(nth ,f ,@args))\n\nIt looks like a macro definition, and does much the same thing.  It\nwill turn\n\n(2 '(a b c))\n\ninto\n\n(nth 2 '(a b c))\n\nThere's a good deal more of the language still to come, including\nnumbers and I/O, but we have now seen the entire Bel interpreter.\n\nNext come several functions for operating on functions. The first,\nfunction, tells whether something is a function and if so what kind.\n\n> (map function (list car append 'foo))\n(prim clo nil)\n\nThe next, con, returns a constant function:\n\n> (map (con 'yo) '(a b c))\n(yo yo yo)\n\nThen comes an important one, compose, which takes any number of\nfunctions and returns their composition. For example, cadr is\nequivalent to a composition of car and cdr:\n\n> ((compose car cdr) '(a b c))\nb\n\nWhen the names of what you're composing are symbols or numbers, Bel\nlets you abbreviate calls to compose with colons.\n\n> (car:cdr '(a b c))\nb\n\nFunctional composition lets you eliminate a lot of unnecessary\nvariables. I warned earlier that the definitions that occur early in\nthe Bel source are not in truly idiomatic Bel, because that would\nrequire things that hadn't been defined yet. Composition is one of\nthem. If you had to define cadr in idiomatic Bel you'd say\n\n(set cadr car:cdr)\n\nThere's a special abbreviation for composing no, which is to prepend\na tilde.\n\n> (map ~cdr '((a) (a b c) (a b)))\n(t nil nil)\n\nNow we can understand the idiomatic definition of all that I gave\nearly on:\n\n(def all (f xs)\n  (~some ~f xs))\n\nIt's actually inaccurate to say that compose operates on functions,\nbecause it can operate on anything that we can call like a function.\n\n> (2:or nil '(a b c))\nb\n\nI could solve this problem by inventing some new term for things\nthat can be called like functions, but that seems a bit bogus, so\ninstead I'm going to be irresponsible and just talk about functions\nwhen I mean things callable like functions. Because the fact is that\njust about anywhere you can use a function, you can use anything else\nthat's callable.\n\nThe next function, combine, produces something more general: it takes\none argument, f, and returns a function that combines functions using\nf. So this for example\n\n((combine and) car cdr)\n\nwill yield a function equivalent to\n\n(fn (x)\n  (and (car x) (cdr x)))\n\n> (map ((combine and) car cdr)\n       '((a . nil) (a . b) (nil . b)))\n(nil t nil)\n\nSince combine of and and or are so frequently needed, we predefine\ntwo functions, cand and cor, for those cases.\n\n> ((cand pair cdr) '(a b))\n(b)\n> ((cor char pair) 'a)\nnil\n\nNext come the two classic reduction functions, left and right fold.\nOnce again, their definitions are complicated by taking any number of\narguments, and they're easier to understand if we start with\nthree-argument versions:\n\n(def foldl3 (f base xs)\n  (if (no xs)\n      base\n      (foldl3 f (f (car xs) base) (cdr xs))))\n\n(def foldr3 (f base xs)\n  (if (no xs)\n      base\n      (f (car xs) (foldr3 f base (cdr xs)))))\n\nWhen we look at these versions it's clear that left fold works by\ngrowing the base case and then returning it when we get to the end of\nthe list, and right fold works by growing a recursive call tree that\nbuilds its value on the way back up.\n\nHere is a series of equivalent calls showing how a left fold plays\nout:\n\n(foldl3 cons nil '(a b))\n(foldl3 cons (cons 'a nil) '(b))\n(foldl3 cons (cons 'b (cons 'a nil)) nil)\n\nThis yields (b a). The corresponding right fold,\n\n(foldr3 cons nil '(a b))\n(cons 'a (foldr3 cons nil '(b)))\n(cons 'a (cons 'b (foldr3 cons nil nil)))\n\nyields (a b).\n\nFor comparison, the reduce function we already have is a right fold\nwhere the base case is the last element of the list.\n\nThe next function, of, is for situations like the following:\n\n(+ (car x) (car y) (car z))\n\nWith it you can write\n\n((of + car) x y z)\n\nAnd upon is a sort of reverse call, in the sense that it saves an\nargument, and then tells you what calling things on that argument\nwill return:\n\n> (map (upon '(a b c))\n       (list car cadr cdr))\n(a b (b c))\n\nThe next function, pairwise, returns true iff its first argument is\ntrue of every two-element window in the second. For example\n\n(pairwise f '(a b c d))\n\nis equivalent to\n\n(and (f 'a 'b) (f 'b 'c) (f 'c 'd))\n\nThat expression\n\n(all [id _ (car args)] (cdr args))\n\nin the definition of = would have been\n\n(pairwise id args)\n\nif we'd had pairwise then.\n\nThe next function, fuse, takes a function that's expected to return\na list, plus one or more lists, and returns the result of appending\ntogether the results of calling the function on successive elements\nof the lists. Which description incidentally demonstrates the\nadvantage of source code over natural language in a spec.\n\n> (fuse [list 'a _] '(1 2 3))\n(a 1 a 2 a 3)\n\nWe use it in letu, which is for creating uvars. In eif we had to say\n\n(with (v (uvar)\n       w (uvar)\n       c (uvar))\n  ...)\n\nWith letu that becomes\n\n(letu (v w c)\n  ...)\n\nYou can also make one uvar by using a single variable instead of a\nlist of variables.\n\nWe use letu in pcase, which is like a case statement but with\npredicates as the keys.\n\n> (map [pcase _\n         no   'empty\n         atom 'atom\n              'pair]\n       '(a nil '(b c)))\n(atom empty pair)\n\nThe next function, match, is like = except that functions occurring\nin the second argument are treated as predicates, and ts match\neverything.\n\n> (match '(a (b) c d) (list 'a pair 'c t))\nt\n\nThe split function breaks its second argument at the point where its\nfirst argument returns true.\n\n> (split (is \\a) \"frantic\")\n(\"fr\" \"antic\")\n\nThe next two macros are for conditionally evaluating blocks of code:\nwhen's body is evaluated when the test is true, and unless's when\nit's false.\n\nNow we come to the code that implements numbers. Before we continue\nI'd like to remind the reader of the principle that when something\nis defined in the Bel source, the goal is to specify what it means\nand not to provide an efficient implementation.\n\nNumbers in Bel take the form\n\n(lit num (sign n d) (sign n d))\n\nwhere the first (sign n d) is the real component and the second the\nimaginary component. A sign is either + or -, and n and d are unary\nintegers (i.e. lists of t) representing a numerator and denominator.\n\nSo 2/3 is\n\n(lit num (+ (t t) (t t t)) (+ () (t)))\n\nand 4-1/2i is\n\n(lit num (+ (t t t t) (t)) (- (t) (t t)))\n\nYou'll never see this representation unless you go looking for it,\nbecause Bel reads and writes numbers in the conventional way.\n\n> (lit num (+ (t t) (t t t)) (+ () (t)))\n2/3\n\nWe're going to build numbers up from the bottom, starting with\noperators for unary integers and finally defining the operators one\nactually uses in programs.\n\nWe start with a selection of constant unsigned integers. Then come a\nset of operators for them. Operators for unsigned integers have names\nbeginning with i. Notice how with unary numbers, arithmetic\noperations turn out to be familiar list operations. E.g. + is append,\nand * is a fold of a fuse. One quirk: since these numbers are\nunsigned, i- has to return two values: the result and an indication\nof whether it's positive or negative.\n\nThe next level of numbers is unsigned rationals, which are (n d)\npairs of unsigned integers. Functions for operating on them begin\nwith r.\n\nThe next level up from that is signed rationals, which are (s n d),\ntriples where s is + or - and (n d) is an unsigned rational.\nOperators on signed rationals begin with s.\n\nThe top level, the numbers that programs actually use, are complex\nnumbers. These have the form shown above. Operators for complex\nnumbers have names beginning with c.\n\nNow that we've defined numbers, we get a series of functions for\nmaking them, recognizing them, and taking them apart.\n\nThe one nontrivial one is simplify, which simplifies a rational by\ndividing both components by their greatest common factor. This is\ncalled by buildnum after reading numbers and after every arithmetic\noperation.\n\nAfter buildnum and recip we see the definitions of the +, -, *, and /\nfunctions that are actually used in programs.\n\n> (+ .05 (/ 19 20))\n1\n\nNow that we have numbers we can define some common functions that use\nthem, like len for finding the length of a list\n\n> (len \"foo\")\n3\n\nand pos for finding the position of something in one\n\n> (pos \\a \"ask\")\n1\n\n(In Bel, lists are one-indexed.)\n\nWe use pos in charn, which returns a unique integer for each\ncharacter based on its position in chars, a list of all the\ncharacters.\n\n> (map charn \"abc\")\n(97 98 99)\n\nWe can also define functions for comparing numbers, and more\ngenerally for comparing things that can be transformed into numbers\nor lists of them.\n\nThe comparison operators used in programs are the familiar < and >.\nThese are defined in terms of bin<, which compares two objects by\nlooking up a comparison function for them.\n\nThe comparison functions for different kinds of objects are kept in\ncomfns, which is a list of pairs of functions (f . g) where f is a\npredicate (e.g. real) and g is a function of two arguments that\nreturns true iff the first is less than the second.\n\nComparison functions are defined using com, and following its\ndefinition we see the four predefined comparison functions, for\nreals, chars, strings, and symbols. So < and > work for arguments of\nthose types,\n\n> (> 3/4 2/3)\nt\n> (< 'apple 'apply)\nt\n\nand if you use com to define a comparison function for other kinds of\nobjects, < and > will work for them too.\n\nNotice that bin< has an explicit test for nil arguments. That's\nbecause nil is both a symbol and a string (the empty string).\n\nThen come a few more predicates on numbers which are mostly used in\ntype checking-- int, whole, and pint (positive integer).\n\nNext comes a familiar name, yc. This is the Y combinator, which is\nused to generate recursive functions. It's used in rfn to make a\nrecursive function with a name,\n\n> ((rfn foo (x) (if (no x) 0 (inc:foo:cdr x))) '(a b c))\n3\n\nand rfn in turn is used to define afn, which lets you refer to a\nfunction within itself as self.\n\n> ((afn (x) (if (no x) 0 (inc:self:cdr x))) '(a b c))\n3\n\nWe use afn in wait, which takes a function and calls it till it\nreturns a non-nil value.\n\n> (set x '(nil nil a b c))\n(nil nil a b c)\n> (wait (fn () (pop x)))\na\n> x\n(b c)\n\n(We haven't defined pop yet but it's the usual pop.)\n\nThe function runs takes a function and a list and breaks up the list\ninto stretches for which the function returns true or false.\n\n> (runs pint '(1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0))\n((1 1) (0 0 0) (1 1 1) (0))\n\nUsing whitec, which returns true of whitespace characters, we can use\nruns to pick the words out of a string:\n\n> (tokens \"the age of the essay\")\n(\"the\" \"age\" \"of\" \"the\" \"essay\")\n\nBut since tokens can take any function or object to treat as a break,\nyou can use it for more than picking out words.\n\nThe function dups returns all the elements of a list that occur more\nthan once in it.\n\n> (dups \"abracadabra\")\n\"abr\"\n\nThe next function, simple, is a predicate true of atoms and numbers.\nYou need this for e.g. the base case of tree traversals.\n\nThe do1 macro is like do except that it returns the value of the\nfirst expression in its body rather than the last. We'll see an\nexample soon when we get to the queue functions.\n\nThe consif function conses something onto the front of a list only if\nit's non-nil.\n\n> (consif (cadr '(a)) '(x y))\n(x y)\n\nThe check macro evaluates an expression and returns its value only if\nits second argument returns true of it.\n\n> (check (car '(1 2 3)) odd)\n1\n> (check (car '(1 2 3)) even)\nnil\n\nThe optional third argument is an expression to evaluate to get an\nalternate value in case the function returns false.\n\n> (check (car '(1 2 3)) even 2)\n2\n\nThe withs macro is like with except that the bindings of the\npreceding variables are visible in the expressions defining the\nvalues of later ones.\n\n> (let x 'a\n    (withs (x 'b\n            y x)\n      y))\nb\n\nThe bind macro is like a call to dyn with a body. Since bind is a\ngeneralization of dyn, you would not ordinarily use dyn in programs.\n\nThe atomic macro uses bind to bind lock during the evaluation of its\nbody. As we saw earlier in mev, the current thread won't be\ninterrupted so long as lock is dynamically bound in it to a non-nil\nvalue. So if you have a series of expressions that you don't want\ninterrupted because they'd leave something in an inconsistent state,\nyou can protect them by wrapping an atomic around them.\n\nThe tail function returns the rest of its second argument from the\npoint where its first argument returns true of it, if any.\n\n> (tail [caris _ \\-] \"non-nil\")\n\"-nil\"\n\nThe function dock takes the last element off a list\n\n> (dock '(a b c))\n(a b)\n\nwhile lastcdr returns the last non-nil cdr of a list\n\n> (lastcdr '(a b c))\n(c)\n\nand last uses it to get the last element.\n\n> (last '(a b c))\nc\n\nNow come three functions for manipulating queues. A queue is\nrepresented as a list within a list. That way several variables can\nbe set to the same queue.\n\nIf you modify the middle of a list that is the value of several\nvariables, the modification is shared:\n\n> (set x '(a b c) y x)\n(a b c)\n> (set (cadr x) 'z)\nz\n> y\n(a z c)\n\nBut there is no way to put something on the front of a list in a way\nthat will be shared by multiple variables that were set to it. We\nhaven't gotten to push yet, but I'll use it anyway to make this\nclear. When you push something on the front of a list, you're\nmodifying the value of a variable, not the list structure itself.\n\n> (push 'hello x)\n(hello a z c)\n> x\n(hello a z c)\n> y\n(a z c)\n\nTo modify a value that several variables share, you have to be able to\ntranslate it into changing the car or cdr of some existing pair. And\nif the shared value is a list within a list, you can.\n\n> (set x '((a)) y x)\n((a))\n> y\n((a))\n> (push 'hello (car x))\n(hello a)\n> y\n((hello a))\n\nThat's why queues are represented as lists within lists.\n\nYou make a new queue with newq, put something in a queue with enq,\nand take something off with deq.\n\n> (set x (newq))\n(nil)\n> (enq 'a x)\n((a))\n> (enq 'b x)\n((a b))\n> (deq x)\na\n> x\n((b))\n\nNotice enq and deq use atomic. Otherwise you could get errors if code\nin another thread did something to a queue while you were in the\nmiddle of doing something to it.\n\nNext we see the set macro itself. This calls hug to assemble the\nimplicit pairs of arguments, and then for each pair (p e) generates\nan expression in which a where is wrapped around p, and then the\nappropriate half of the resulting pair is set to the value of e.\nSo e.g.\n\n(set (car x) 'a)\n\nis expanded into the equivalent of\n\n(atomic (let v 'a\n          (let (cell loc) (where (car x) t)\n            ((case loc a xar d xdr) cell v))))\n\nWe also have a more general macro, zap, that modifies the value of\nsomething by applying a function to it.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (zap cdr x)\n    x)\n(b c)\n\nIt's instructive to compare the definitions of set and zap. They're\nmuch the same, except that zap has to wrap a call to apply around the\ncurrent value of the appropriate half of the pair returned by where.\n\nOne subtle difference: the second argument to where in set is t,\nwhereas in zap it's omitted (and thus defaults to nil). That's\nbecause setting an unbound variable should create a binding for it,\nbut zapping one shouldn't.\n\nWith zap it becomes easy to write a whole class of other macros we\nneed, like ++ and --, which increase and decrease the value of\nsomething\n\n> (let x '(1 2 3)\n    (++ (car x) 10)\n    (-- (cadr x))\n    x)\n(11 1 3)\n\nand push and pull, which put something onto the front of a list and\nremove something from one\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (push 'z x)\n    (pull 'c x)\n    x)\n(z a b)\n\nSince pull passes the optional comparison function to rem, we can say\n\n> (let x '(7 3 0 9 2 4 1)\n    (pull 4 x >=)\n    x)\n(3 0 2 1)\n\nI think this sort of \"porosity\" is in general a good idea. There's a\ncase to be made for treating functions as black boxes, but with\nmacros you often want to acknowledge what a macro expands into and\npass through its optional arguments if you can.\n\nNow we have all the operators we need to write the Bel reader. This\nis like an inverted pyramid built upon the rdb primitive, which reads\na single bit.\n\nWe want to be able both to read a character from a stream and also to\nlook at the stream to see what character is waiting to be read. We\nsimulate that with a global list of \"unconsumed\" characters, one for\neach open stream, kept as a list of (stream . char) pairs in cbuf.\nAt first the only open input stream is the initial one, represented\nby nil, so cbuf starts out with one entry, (nil . nil), which is\n(nil).\n\nAfter cbuf we see open and close, which call the ops and cls\nprimitives respectively, but also create and delete cbuf entries for\nthe streams involved.\n\nNext comes peek, which tells you the next character waiting to be\nread from a stream. As well as streams, the Bel I/O functions take\nqueues of characters (i.e. strings within lists), and that's what\nthe first test in peek is checking for. If s is a queue, peek just\nreturns the first element. Otherwise it begins by checking cbuf to\nsee if it contains a character for this stream. If it does, peek\nreturns it. Otherwise it calls bitc to try to read a new character.\n\nThe bitc function is where bits returned by rdb get turned into\ncharacters. It accumulates bits in bbuf, which is a list of\n(stream . bits) pairs. Once bits = the representation of some\ncharacter in chars, bitc returns that character.\n\nThe rdb primitive is non-blocking, meaning if no bit is currently\navailable from the stream passed to it, it returns nil instead of\nwaiting for one. Since bitc does the same, returning nil immediately\nif it gets nil back from rdb, it's non-blocking too. But the wait\nexpression in peek means it won't return till bitc gives it a\ncharacter or eof. If peek gets an eof, it returns nil.\n\nNext comes rdc, which is like peek but consumes the character it\nreturns. I.e. if a source has characters waiting to be read, repeated\ncalls to peek will return the same character, and repeated calls to\nrdc will return successive ones.\n\n> (let s '(\"abc\")\n    (list (peek s) (peek s)))\n\"aa\"\n> (let s '(\"abc\")\n    (list (rdc s) (rdc s)))\n\"ab\"\n\nThe structure of rdc is similar to that of peek. First check if the\nargument is a stream. If it is, either return whatever's stored in\ncbuf (wiping the cbuf entry in the process) or call bitc.\n\nLike peek, rdc waits till bitc gives it a character or eof, and\nreturns nil in the latter case.\n\nThen come some functions for recognizing types of characters.\nWhether a character is a digit depends on the base, which is why\ndigit takes an optional base argument.\n\n> (digit \\a)\nnil\n> (digit \\a i16)\nt\n\nThe next function, breakc, returns true iff a character signals the\nend of a symbol or number. Among the characters treated as breakcs\nare those used as keys in syntax; we'll see soon which those are.\n\nThe signc function returns true iff its argument is a numeric sign,\nand intrac is for detecting characters that have a special meaning\nif they occur within symbols. I'll explain what they do when we get\nto that part of the reader.\n\nThe source function returns true iff its argument is something that\ncan be read from, i.e. either nil (representing the initial input\nand output streams), an object of type stream, or a queue of\ncharacters.\n\nThen comes read itself. All its arguments are optional: a source to\nread from, which defaults to ins, the default input stream; a base to\nread numbers in, which defaults to 10; and a value to return in case\nof eof, which defaults to nil.\n\nIn read we see the first parameters with type restrictions; the first\nargument has to be a source, and the second has to be between 2 and\n16 inclusive. You can use type checking however you like, but I\npersonally use it only to catch errors that won't be caught\notherwise.\n\nThen comes saferead, which is like read but returns an alternate\nvalue if there's an error or we get an eof from the stream.\n\nFinally comes the actual reader, rdex, which is to reading what ev\nis to evaluation. There is one new parameter in rdex: share, which is\na list of shared structure we've encountered so far.\n\nSometimes it matters when the same pair occurs multiple times in a\ntree. For example, when we used smark to mark special stack entries\nin the interpreter, it mattered that the cars of such entries were id\nto smark and not merely = to it. The Bel printer and reader use\nlabels of the form #n, where n is whole number, to mark shared pairs.\nFor example:\n\n> (let x '(a)\n    (list x x))\n(#1=(a) #1)\n> (set x '(a #1=(b) #1 c))\n(a #1=(b) #1 c)\n> (id (2 x) (3 x))\nt\n\nThe share parameter keeps track of shared objects we've read so far,\nand their labels. It's passed to most functions in the reader, and\nmost return two values: whatever has been read, and the share list.\n\nThe first thing rdex does is call eatwhite to consume any whitespace\nbefore the object it's trying to read. There are two kinds of\nwhitespace, corresponding to the two clauses in eatwhite: invisible\ncharacters like spaces and linefeeds, and comments, which begin with\nsemicolons and continue till the end of the current line. In the\nlatter case we call charstil to consume all the characters up to the\nnext linefeed.\n\nWhen it has finished reading whitespace, rdex can do one of three\nthings depending on what rdc sees next. If rdc returns nil, that\nmeans the stream is out of characters, and we return whatever we've\nbeen told to return in case of eof. Otherwise the value returned by\nrdc is either a syntax character, like e.g. a left parenthesis or a\ndouble quote, in which case we have something special to do, or an\nordinary character, in which case we call rdword, which reads a word\n(roughly a symbol or number).\n\nThe syntax characters are for rdex what special forms are for ev.\nLike forms, syntax is a list of (char . function) pairs that\ndescribe what to do if each character is encountered. There is a syn\noperator, akin to form, that defines the behavior of each character.\nThe first syn, for example, defines what happens when the reader\nencounters a left parenthesis: it calls rdlist to read the elements,\nstopping when it encounters a right parenthesis.\n\nIf we skip down to rdlist, we see that it too begins with an\neatwhite. Then there are several cases depending on what predicate\nis true of whatever's seen by peek. If there's no character, then we\nhave a read error, because we at least need to see the list\nterminator (e.g. right parenthesis) before we're done. If it's a\nperiod, then we call rddot to handle that case. If it's the list\nterminator we were looking for, then we're done reading this list,\nwhich we've been accumulating in acc, and we can return it.\nOtherwise the character is the beginning of the next element of the\nlist, so we call rdex to read it, and then call rdlist recursively\nwith the new object snocced onto the end of acc.\n\nLet's take a look at rddot, which is not simply for reading dotted\nlists, because we could also be seeing something (e.g. a decimal\nnumber) that begins with a period. Which it is depends on whether\nthere's a breakc after the period. If there is, we call hard-rdex to\nread whatever object is in the cdr of the list. This function is\nlike rdex but signals an error if it can't read anything.\n\nIf we look at the syn for a right parenthesis, on the other hand, all\nit does is call error. That's because a syn says what to do when\nyou're starting to read something, and since rdlist always reads all\nthe way to the matching right parenthesis, if you encounter a right\nparenthesis when you're starting to read something, what you're\nseeing must be an unbalanced parenthesis.\n\nThere's a similar pattern for \\[ and \\], except that we do something\nwith the list we've read: we make it into a fn expression.\n\n> (read '(\"[cons _ 'b]\"))\n(fn (_) (cons _ (quote b)))\n\nThe sym for \\\\ shows how characters are represented. A backslash can\neither be followed by the character itself, or the name of one. The\nnames of characters like \\bel that have them are kept in namecs.\n\nNext come the syns for quote, backquote, and comma. They all call\nrdwrap, which does a hard-rdex, and then wraps the corresponding\noperator around it.\n\nThen comes the syn for \\\", which calls rddelim to read a sequence of\ncharacters up to the next \\\". Within the sequence of characters, a\nbackslash acts as an escape character, meaning whatever occurs next\nis treated as part of the sequence, even if it's the delimiter that\nwould otherwise signal the end.\n\n> \"foo\\\"bar\"\n\"foo\\\"bar\"\n\nThe escape character is not part of the string, just something used\nin its representation.\n\n> (mem \\\\ \"foo\\\"bar\")\nnil\n\nThe character \\¦ acts as a delimiter for symbol names that could not\notherwise be read. It works just like \\\" except that we call sym on\nthe result.\n\n> '¦foo bar¦\n¦foo bar¦\n\nAs we saw earlier, the character \\# indicates shared list structure.\nIf the #n occurs alone, it refers to a previously seen object; if\nit's followed by =, then it becomes the label for whatever is read\nnext.\n\nIn the latter case we call rdtarget to read it. This function does\nsome slightly odd things. It creates the pair (cell) to represent the\nobject it will read before it's read, then when it does read\nsomething (e), it writes its car and cdr into the car and cdr of\ncell, and returns that. Why? Why not just return e? So that we can\nread lists that contain themselves. If we want to be able to read\nsomething like\n\n#1=(a #1 b)\n\nwe need to add it to the list of shared objects before reading it. Or\nmore precisely, add to the list of shared objects a pair that we will\nlater turn into it.\n\nNow we come to rdword, which reads either a number, a symbol, or\nseveral numbers or symbols joined by intrasymbol characters like \\:.\n\nUnlike many other parts of the reader, this code knows from the start\nwhich characters it's dealing with: everything up to the next breakc.\nIt first tries to parse those characters as a number, by calling\nparsenum. If that fails, the next level of precedence is the vertical\nbar used in type specs. There is nothing specific to parameter lists\nabout this bar, incidentally; it's just something the reader expands\ninto a list beginning with t.\n\n> 'for|2\n(t for 2)\n\nIf there's no vertical bar, we look for the intrasymbol characters\n\\. and \\!. These are expanded by the reader into common expressions.\n\na.b expands into (a b)\n\na!b expands into (a 'b)\n\nSo for example if you wanted to insist that a parameter was a\ncontinuation, instead of expressing the parameter as\n\n(t c (isa 'cont))\n\nyou could just write\n\nc|isa!cont\n\nand our recent example\n\n(id (2 x) (3 x))\n\ncould have been written\n\n(id 2.x 3.x)\n\nI haven't used this notation so far in the Bel spec, but it's quite\nconvenient. Any combination of \\. and \\! is allowed.\n\n> 'a!b.c\n(a (quote b) c)\n\nIf there is nothing before the first \\. or \\!, the missing symbol is\ntreated as an implicit upon.\n\n> '!a\n(upon (quote a))\n> (let x '(a . b)\n    (map .x (list car cdr)))\n(a b)\n\nThe next level of precedence, represented by parsecom, is intrasymbol\ncolons. These, as we've seen, are abbreviations for compose\nexpressions.\n\n> 'a:b:c\n(compose a b c)\n\nThe next level of predence is prepended tildes, which as we've also\nseen are abbreviations for no expressions. Here's some of each:\n\n> 'x|~f:g!a\n(t x ((compose (compose no f) g) (quote a)))\n\nThe lowest level of precedence is the else clause of parseno, where\nwe try to parse a number, and failing that (since there can now be no\nintrasymbol characters in it), treat whatever we've got left as a\nsymbol.\n\nThat's the end of the reader. Next comes the definition of the bquote\nmacro. This is not part of the reader per se; the syns for \\` and \\,\nmerely yield bquote and comma expressions; but it feels like a part\nof the reader in the sense that you never use bquote or comma\nexpressions directly.\n\nThe bquote macro is the biggest in the Bel source, and gives a taste\nof how macros, as they become more powerful, can become like\ncompilers.\n\nThe general goal of backquote is to turn an expression containing\nbackquotes, commas, and comma-ats into calls to the familiar\nlist-building functions cons and append. To get an idea of what we're\naiming at, here are some backquoted expressions followed by their\nexpansions:\n\n  `(x ,y)          (cons (quote x) (cons y nil))\n\n  `(x ,@y)         (cons (quote x) (append y nil))\n\n  `(,x ,@y)        (cons x (append y nil))\n\n  `(,@x ,@y)       (append x (append y nil))\n\n  `(x . ,@y)       (apply cons (quote x) y)\n\n  `(,@x . ,@y)     (apply append x y)\n\nThese are not quite the expansions generated by bquote. I've cut some\nerror-checking code to make them clearer.\n\nMuch of the complexity of bqex is due to the need to handle nested\nbackquotes. We'll find it easier to understand bqex if we start with\na version that doesn't:\n\n(def bqex1 (e)\n  (if (no e)   (list nil nil)\n      (atom e) (list (list 'quote e) nil)\n               (case (car e)\n                 comma    (list (cadr e) t)\n                 comma-at (list (list 'splice (cadr e)) t)\n                          (bqexpair1 e))))\n\n(def bqexpair1 (e)\n  (with ((a achange) (bqex1 (car e))\n         (d dchange) (bqex1 (cdr e)))\n    (if (or achange dchange)\n        (list (if (caris d 'splice)\n                  (if (caris a 'splice)\n                      `(apply append (spa ,(cadr a)) (spd ,(cadr d)))\n                      `(apply cons ,a (spd ,(cadr d))))\n                  (caris a 'splice)\n                  `(append (spa ,(cadr a)) ,d)\n                  `(cons ,a ,d))\n              t)\n        (list (list 'quote e) nil))))\n\nNow it's easier to follow what will happen to an expression as it\ngets expanded.\n\nThe bqex1 function returns two values: an expansion, and a second\nvalue indicating whether anything changed in generating it. For\nexample, if we expand an expression containing no commas or\ncomma-ats, nothing need change.\n\n> (bqex1 '(x y z))\n((quote (x y z)) nil)\n\nThat call will go through the last clause of bqex1, and then, since\nthe recursive calls to bqex1 on the car and cdr at the start of\nbqexpair1 will get nil values for both achange and dchange, we'll go\nthrough the last clause of bqexpair1 as well.\n\nNow suppose we do have a comma or comma-at in our expression. The\nbase cases of bqex1 are for when the whole of e is a comma or\ncomma-at expression. When it's a comma expression, the expansion is\nsimply its argument.\n\n> (bqex1 '(comma x))\n(x t)\n\nBut when it's a comma-at expression, the expansion is a call to\nsplice:\n\n> (bqex1 '(comma-at x))\n((splice x) t)\n\nWhat's splice? If we look at its definition, it simply signals an\nerror. Why generate an expansion that signals an error? Because if\nthe expression we're expanding is a naked comma-at, meaning one\nthat's not within a list, we should signal an error; there's nothing\nto splice the value into.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    `,@x)\nError: comma-at-outside-list\n\nNow let's see what happens when we have comma and comma-at\nexpressions within a list. In that case we call bqexpair1, which\ngenerates expansions for its car and cdr, and then puts them\ntogether to make an expansion for the whole list.\n\nSuppose we're expanding\n\n`(,x . ,@y)\n\nThe car and cdr of this list are the two cases we just examined.\nI.e. within bqexpair1\n\n(a achange)\n\nwill be\n\n(x t)\n\nand\n\n(d dchange)\n\nwill be\n\n((splice y) t)\n\nWhat happens when these get put together? Since the car of d is a\nsplice expression and the car of a isn't, we go through this clause\n\n`(apply cons ,a (spd ,(cadr d)))\n\nyielding\n\n(apply cons x (spd y))\n\nNotice that the splice put on the front of its return value by bqex1\nis taken back off when the return value gets back to bqexpair1.\nThat's why expansions of comma-ats don't always signal errors; it's\nonly a \"leftover\" splice that signals an error.\n\nThe call to spd is the error-checking code that I mentioned I cut\nfrom the examples above. As long as y is the right sort of value,\nmeaning a list of one element, spd simply returns it. But it also\nsignals an error if it's not.\n\n> (let x '(b c)\n    `(a . ,@x))\nError: splice-multiple-cdrs\n\nYou can't splice anything except a one-element list into the cdr of\na pair. The case above is like writing (a . b c), which is\nill-formed.\n\nHere's an example of this expansion in action:\n\n> (with (x 'a y '(b))\n    `(,x . ,@y))\n(a . b)\n\nAll the code that you see in the Bel source but not in bqex1 is for\ndealing with nested backquotes. The additional argument, n, is the\nnesting level, represented by an actual nested list. The function\nbqthru is for going through comma and comma-at operators to get at\nthe ones within that need to be expanded, since the outermost\nbackquote matches the innermost comma or comma-at. We increment the\nnesting level (by saying (list n)) each time we go through a bquote,\nand decrement it (by saying (car n)) each time we go through a comma\nor comma-at. Until the nesting level is nil, whereupon we expand\nthe comma or comma-at as in the examples above.\n\n> (bqex '(bquote (comma (comma x))) nil)\n((list (quote bquote) (list (quote comma) x)) t)\n\nNotice here for example we expand the innermost comma expression, but\nleave the outer one \"intact,\" in the sense of turning it into a call\nto list that makes a new comma expression.\n\nLike the splice macro, the comma and comma-at macros signal errors\nif they're ever called. In a well-formed backquote expression they\nnever do get called, because they're expanded away. They only get\ncalled when there are \"leftover\" commas or comma-ats that don't have\nmatching backquotes.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n       `,,x)\nError: comma-outside-backquote\n\nNow we come to the printer. The print function takes an object and\nan optional stream and prints the object to the stream. There are\ntwo other optional parameters, names and hist, which programs are\nunlikely to supply explicitly; the first is a list of shared\nstructure, which as we saw in read has to be displayed in a special\nway, and hist is a list of pairs printed so far.\n\nThere are four cases in print. If the thing we're printing is simple,\nmeaning an atom or number, we call prsimple to print it. In prsimple\nthere are four cases; two of them, chars and streams, are handled\nright there.\n\nIn the clause for chars we're down to printing individual characters\nwith prc. This in turn uses wrb to write the bits in the character's\nbinary representation (or simply enqueues the character, if printing\nto a queue).\n\nNotice that prsimple doesn't print streams in a way that can be read\nback in, or even distinguished from one another. Streams have no\nreadable representation.\n\nNearly all the complexity in prsymbol is for dealing with symbols\nthat need to have \\¦s around their names because otherwise they'd be\nunreadable. If it weren't for that possibility, prsymbol could be\n\n(map [prc _ s] (nom x))\n\nThe way we check if a symbol needs to have \\¦s around its name is by\ncalling read on the characters in its name. If we don't get the same\nsymbol back, we need to wrap it in \\¦s. In the middle of which we call\npresc to print the characters in the symbol with backslashes before\nany \\¦s.\n\nTo print a number we call prnum on its real and imaginary components.\nThis in turn calls rrep to generate fractional representations of\nunsigned rationals. Bel can read numbers in decimal format, but\ninternally they're rationals and are displayed that way.\n\n> 1.5\n3/2\n\nNow back up to print, where the next clause is for printing strings.\nThis is complicated by the fact that strings are lists and can thus\nshare structure with other things we're printing. If ustring says\nthat our string is a unique one, meaning one that doesn't share\nstructure with anything in names, then we can simply print it as a\nseries of characters between double quotes (using presc in case there\nis a double quote in the string).\n\n> \"foo\"\n\"foo\"\n\nThe next clause in print checks whether the thing we're printing is\none of the shared objects in names. If it is, we have to display it\nusing either #n=... if it's not in hist (meaning this is the first\ntime we're printing it) or as #n if it is.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (list x x))\n(#1=(a b c) #1)\n\nTo print a pair we call prpair. This prints parentheses around a call\nto prelts that prints the contents of the pair. In prelts we begin by\ncalling print recursively on the car. Then we have to decide how to\nprint the cdr. If it's simple, or a unique string, or shared\nstructure, we display the list as a dotted list.\n\n> (cons 'a 5)\n(a . 5)\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (cons x x))\n(#1=(a b c) . #1)\n\nOtherwise we print a space and call prelts recursively on rest.\n\n> (append '(a b c) 5)\n(a b c . 5)\n\nFinally come a couple of functions for printing in specific\nsituations. The first is prn, which is used to display data, e.g. for\ndebugging. It takes any number of arguments and prints them separated\nby spaces, followed by a newline.\n\n> (with (x \"foo\" y 'bar)\n    (prn 'x x 'y y))\nx \"foo\" y bar\nbar\n\nIt returns the value of the last, so you can wrap a call to prn\naround any expression in your code without changing what it returns.\n\nThe second, pr, is for displaying messages to humans. If you're\nlooking at data, you want to print strings in double quotes, but if\nyou're printing a message to a user, you probably don't. E.g.\n\n(let user 'Dave\n  (pr \"I'm sorry, \" user \". I'm afraid I can't do that.\"))\n\nwill print\n\nI'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.\n\nIt calls prnice to print its arguments in a readable form.\n\nThe remaining definitions in the Bel source aren't needed to write\nthe interpreter or read or print, but are useful in programs.\n\nThe drop function takes n elements off the front of a list\n\n> (drop 2 '(a b c d e))\n(c d e)\n\nand nth returns the nth element of one.\n\n> (nth 2 '(a b c d e))\nb\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, lists in Bel are 1-indexed.\n\nWe use nth in the virtual function for numbers, which I also included\nearlier.\n\n> (2 '(a b c))\nb\n\nWe see this in use in nchar, which is the converse of charn. It\nconverts a number to a character.\n\n> (nchar 65)\n\\A\n\nThe first function is the complement of drop. It returns a list of\nthe first n elements of a list.\n\n> (first 2 '(a b c d e))\n(a b)\n\nThe catch macro is used to establish a continuation to which we can\nthrow control if we want to abort a computation. It dynamically binds\nthrow to the continuation, so whatever argument we give to throw will\nbe returned as the value of the catch expression.\n\n> (catch\n    (throw 'a)\n    (/ 1 0))\na\n\nThe cut function returns the elements of a list from its second\nargument to its third inclusive,\n\n> (cut \"foobar\" 2 4)\n\"oob\"\n\nunless the second argument is negative, in which case it indicates\nhow many elements to take off the end of the list.\n\n> (cut \"foobar\" 2 -1)\n\"ooba\"\n\nThe whenlet macro is to when as iflet is to if. It's used in awhen,\nwhich is to when as aif is to if.\n\nThe each macro causes its body to be evaluated with a variable bound\nto successive elements of a list.\n\n> (let x nil\n       (each y '(a b c)\n         (push y x))\n       x)\n(c b a)\n\nNow come several functions on functions. The first, flip, takes a\nfunction and returns a function that calls it with the parameters\nreversed.\n\n> ((flip -) 1 10)\n9\n\nThe next, part, is for partial application. It takes a function and\nseveral arguments, and returns a function that will call it with\nthose arguments plus whatever additional ones are supplied.\n\n> ((part cons 'a) 'b)\n(a . b)\n\nAs its name suggests, trap is a backwards part; it puts the newer\narguments first.\n\n> ((trap cons 'a) 'b)\n(b . a)\n\nFinally, only takes a function and returns a function that calls it\nonly if its first argument is non-nil. So instead of\n\n(let x (f)\n  (if x (g x)))\n\nor\n\n(aif (f) (g it))\n\nyou can say just\n\n(only.g (f))\n\nSo for example find, which we defined\n\n(def find (f xs)\n  (aif (some f xs) (car it)))\n\ncould with only and composition be defined\n\n(set find only.car:some)\n\nIncidentally, these examples show the sort of situation where\nintrasymbol dot notation is useful. You wouldn't want to use it for\nevery expression in a program, but it's readable when used with a\n\"modifier\" like only.\n\nThese are followed by some functions involving numbers, including\n>= and <=, floor, which returns the largest integer <= its argument,\nand ceil, which returns the smallest integer >= its argument.\n\n> (map (upon 3.5) (list floor ceil))\n(3 4)\n\nThe mod function returns its first argument modulo its second,\n\n> (mod 17 3)\n2\n\nThen come a group of macros for iteration. The first, whilet,\nevaluates its body while a test expression returns true, with a\nvariable bound to its value.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (whilet y (pop x)\n      (pr y))\n    x)\nabcnil\n\nThen comes the general loop macro, which sets a variable to an\ninitial value, then updates the value on successive iterations, so\nlong as some test expression is true.\n\n> (loop x 1 (+ x 1) (< x 5)\n    (pr x))\n1234nil\n\nSeveral other iteration macros can then be defined in terms of loop,\nstarting with while\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (while (pop x)\n      (pr x)))\n(b c)(c)nilnil\n\nThe til macro evaluates its body with a variable bound to the value\nof one expression till another expression returns true.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (til y (pop x) (= y 'c)\n      (pr y))\n    x)\nab(d e)\n\nWhile it might seem as if you could define whilet simply as\n\n(mac whilet (var expr . body)\n  `(til ,var ,expr (no ,var) ,@body))\n\nthis would fail if var were a pair.\n\nThe for macro starts a variable at some initial value and then\nincrements it by 1 on each succeeding pass through the loop, till it\nexceeds some threshold.\n\n> (for x 1 10\n    (pr x))\n12345678910nil\n\nThe repeat macro simply evaluates its body a certain number of\ntimes.\n\n> (repeat 3\n    (pr 'bang))\nbangbangbangnil\n\nAnd the poll macro evaluates an expression till a function is true of\nthe result, at which point it's returned.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (poll (pop x) is!c)\n    x)\n(d e)\n\nThe accum macro takes a variable and a body of code and evaluates the\nbody with the variable lexically bound to a function that accumulates\nall the values it's called on. It returns the list of values.\n\n> (accum a\n    (map (cand odd a) '(1 2 3 4 5)))\n(1 3 5)\n\nIt's used in nof, which takes a number and an expression and returns\nthe result of evaluating the expression that number of times.\n\n> (nof 10 (rand 10))\n(9 7 6 2 9 1 7 0 0 0)\n\n(Sequences of random numbers never look random enough.)\n\nThe drain function is a combination of poll and accum. It evaluates\nsome expression till it returns nil, or a value passing some other\noptional test, and returns a list of all the values the expression\nreturned.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (drain (pop x)))\n(a b c d e)\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (drain (pop x) is!d))\n(a b c)\n\nThe ^w function returns a number raised to a whole power.\n\n> (^w 2+3i 3)\n-46+9i\n\nThe randlen function returns a random number that can be represented\nin n binary digits, which is the same as saying a random integer\nbetween 0 and 2^n-1 inclusive. It works by generating such a digit\nstring and calling read on it. Within randlen we see the first use of\nthe coin primitive, which randomly returns t or nil.\n\nThe clog2 function returns the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of its\nargument. It and randlen are used to build the general rand function,\nwhich takes a positive integer n and returns a random integer between\n0 and n-1 inclusive.\n\nNext come a group of macros for assignment, starting with wipe, which\nsets multiple things to nil.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (wipe 2.x 4.x)\n    x)\n(a nil c nil e)\n\nThen we get the familiar pop macro, which takes the first element off\na list and returns it.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (list (pop x) x))\n(a (b c))\n\nLike any macro that uses where for assignment, pop can operate on any\npair that you can find a way to refer to.\n\n> (let x '(a b c)\n    (pop (cdr x))\n    x)\n(a c)\n\nThe clean macro removes everything from a list for which its first\nargument returns true:\n\n> (let x '(1 2 3 4 5)\n    (clean odd x)\n    x)\n(2 4)\n\nAnd swap rotates the values of its arguments\n\n> (let (x y z) '(a b c)\n    (swap x y z)\n    (list x y z))\n(b c a)\n\nas a degenerate case of which, if there are two arguments, it swaps\ntheir values.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (swap 2.x 4.x)\n    x)\n(a d c b e)\n\nThe adjoin function conses something onto a list only if it's not\nalready an element of it.\n\n> (adjoin 'a '(a b c))\n(a b c)\n> (adjoin 'z '(a b c))\n(z a b c)\n\nIt's used in pushnew, which pushes an element on a list if it's not\nalready an element.\n\n> (let x '(a b c d e)\n    (pushnew 'a x)\n    (pushnew 'z x)\n    x)\n(z a b c d e)\n\nThe dedup function returns a version of list without the later\ninstances of duplicate elements.\n\n> (dedup \"abracadabra\")\n\"abrcd\"\n\nNext come a group of functions involving sorting. The first inserts\nan element into a (presumably sorted) list according to a comparison\nfunction f.\n\n> (insert < 3 '(1 2 4 5))\n(1 2 3 4 5)\n\nThen we get sort itself, which uses insert to sort a list.\n\n> (sort < '(5 1 3 2 4))\n(1 2 3 4 5)\n\nAs much as possible of the original order is preserved.\n\n> (sort (of > len) '((a b) (c) (d e) (f)))\n((a b) (d e) (c) (f))\n\nThe best function takes a function and a list and returns the\nelement of the list that beats the others according to the function.\n\n> (best > '(5 1 3 2 4))\n5\n\nIn case of ties it will return the first.\n\n> (best (of > len) '((a) (b c) (d e) (f)))\n(b c)\n\nIt's used by max to return the largest of its arguments\n\n> (max 3 7 2 1)\n7\n\nand by min to return the smallest.\n\n> (min 3 7 2 1)\n1\n\nSometimes you want to use max and min on individual arguments and\nsometimes on a list. If we define them for the former case we can get\nthe latter with apply.\n\nThe even function returns true of even numbers, and odd of odd ones.\n\n> (map upon.3 (list even odd))\n(nil t)\n\nAnd round rounds its argument to the nearest integer, choosing even\nintegers in case of ties.\n\n> (map round '(-2.5 -1.5 -1.4 1.4 1.5 2.5))\n(-2 -2 -1 1 2 2)\n\nNext come a group of functions for operating on files. The first is a\nsort of let for files; it opens one, lexically binds the resulting\nstream to a variable within the body, then uses an after to make sure\nthe stream gets closed. If we evaluate\n\n(withfile s \"foo\" 'out\n  (print 'hello s)\n  (prc \\  s)\n  (print 'filesystem s))\n\nThe file \"foo\" will contain\n\nhello filesystem\n\nIt's used in from and to, which dynamically bind ins and outs (the\ndefault input and output streams) to the newly opened file. So if\nwe say\n\n(to \"foo\"\n  (map prn '(a b c)))\n\nthen \"foo\" will end up containing\n\na\nb\nc\n\nand thus\n\n> (from \"foo\"\n    (drain (read)))\n(a b c)\n\nThe function readall uses the same technique to read all the objects\nin a file, except it uses a unique pair to signal eof so that it can\nreturn nil as well.\n\n> (from \"foo\"\n    (readall))\n(a b c)\n\nThe load function reads all the objects in a file and also evaluates\nthem. This is how you load a file of code.\n\n> (to \"example.bel\"\n    (print '(def foo (x) (cons 'a x))))\nnil\n> (load \"example.bel\")\nnil\n> (foo 'b)\n(a . b)\n\nThe record macro is used for making a transcript. It binds outs to a\nnewly created queue, then at the end returns the characters it\ncontains.\n\n> (record\n    (pr 'what)\n    (pr \\ )\n    (pr \"he said\"))\n\"what he said\"\n\nThe function prs uses it to print its arguments to a string.\n\n> (prs 'what \\ \"he said\")\n\"what he said\"\n\nThen come functions for operating on arrays. Bel arrays are\nrecursively defined in the sense that an n dimensional array is a\nlist of n-1 dimensional arrays.\n\nWe can get a new array by giving array a list of dimensions and an\noptional default value.\n\n> (set a (array '(2 3) 0))\n(lit arr (lit arr 0 0 0) (lit arr 0 0 0))\n\nNow a is a 2x3 array of zeros.\n\nThe vir for arrs means we can use arrays as if they were functions on\nlists of indices, as implemented by aref. Vectors are one-indexed.\n\n> (a 1 1)\n0\n\nIf we supply fewer indices than the array has dimensions, we get an\narray back instead of a scalar.\n\n> (a 1)\n(lit arr 0 0 0)\n\nLike any reference to part of a pair, array references are settable.\n\n> (++ (a 1 1) 5)\n5\n> a\n(lit arr (lit arr 5 0 0) (lit arr 0 0 0))\n\nIncluding references to subarrays:\n\n> (swap (a 1) (a 2))\n(lit arr 5 0 0)\n> a\n(lit arr (lit arr 0 0 0) (lit arr 5 0 0))\n\nNext come a set of functions for operating on tables, which are\nkey-value stores.\n\nWe make a new one by giving table a list of (key . value) pairs.\n\n> (set k (table '((a . b) (c . d))))\n(lit tab (a . b) (c . d))\n\nThe vir for tabs means we can use tables as virtual functions on\nkeys.\n\n> (k 'a)\nb\n> (k 'z)\nnil\n> (map k '(a c))\n(b d)\n\nBecause we define a loc whose test is isa!tab and which expands\ninto a tabloc expression, we can set table entries and also create\nnew ones implicitly.\n\n> (set k!a 1 k!z 2)\n2\n> k\n(lit tab (z . 2) (a . 1) (c . d))\n\nFinally, tabrem removes all entries with certain keys from a table.\n\n> (tabrem k 'z)\n((a . 1) (c . d))\n> k\n(lit tab (a . 1) (c . d))\n\nThe last code in the Bel source is for defining objects with named\nfields. First we define templates describing these objects, which\nare stored in a global list. The templates can then be used to define\ninstances.\n\nWe call tem with the name of the template followed by pairs of field\nnames and expressions to generate default values for those fields.\nE.g. this defines a two-dimensional point:\n\n(tem point x 0 y 0)\n\nAlthough we used 0s here, you can use any code in a default\nexpression. It will be stored in a closure and called each time a\ndefault value is needed.\n\nHaving defined point, we can make new instances with make\n\n> (set p (make point))\n(lit tab (x . 0) (y . 0))\n\nWe can supply initial arguments if we want, and if we do they\noverride the defaults.\n\n> (set q (make point x 1 y 5))\n(lit tab (x . 1) (y . 5))\n\nNotice that nothing in a point says that it is a point. You can\neasily change that by adding a field called e.g. type, but for\nmaximum flexibility the language doesn't do it for you.\n\nSince instances are tables, we can do to them everything we can do to\ntables.\n\n> p!x\n0\n> (++ p!x)\n1\n> (swap p!x p!y)\n1\n> p\n(lit tab (x . 0) (y . 1))\n\nWe can even add and remove fields, which is either powerful or\nalarming depending on how you feel about such things.\n\nWe start to see the potential of intrasymbol characters and upon in\nfunctions like this one\n\n(set above (of > !y))\n\nwhich tells if points are above another in the sense of having\ngreater y-coordinates.\n\n> (above q p (make point))\nt\n\nFinally, the function readas reads a table as an instance of a\ntemplate. The fields that we read are treated as if they were initial\narguments to make, which means if fields have been added to a\ntemplate since what we're reading was written, it will automatically\nget the new fields with the default values. In my experience that's a\nconvenient feature to have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Kartik Agaram, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nFranke, Joel Franusic, Jared Friedman, Daniel Gackle, Michael Hartl,\nMatt Knox, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Kevin Lacker, Jessica Livingston,\nBill Moorier, Olin Shivers, Nick Sivo, and especially Robert Morris\nfor help with Bel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" 536870913] [170 :nodes/created-time "20220309210344" 536870913] [170 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [170 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220309210344-bel_lang.org" 536870913] [170 :nodes/id "7b2d57bc-1f3c-4ab6-a4d6-b557cc1a7259" 536870913] [170 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [170 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [170 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [170 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [170 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220309210344-bel_lang", "ROAM_ALIASES" "bel", "ID" "7b2d57bc-1f3c-4ab6-a4d6-b557cc1a7259", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220309210344-bel_lang.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [170 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [170 :nodes/title "bel lang" 536870913] [170 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [170 :nodes/value 3.166666626930237 536870913] [171 :links/dest "\"2edcdb52-f77b-477c-8af5-c8c2eb8c5353\"" 536870913] [171 :links/pos 165 536870913] [171 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [171 :links/source "\"4abaafc1-f6ec-4db0-a299-8a6d2ed74390\"" 536870913] [171 :links/type "\"id\"" 536870913] [171 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       4abaafc1-f6ec-4db0-a299-8a6d2ed74390\n:END:\n#+title: Programming Interviews Exposed book\n\n[[id:876a8e7d-8daf-4e9a-9f05-30eb0ea81061][books]] [[id:2edcdb52-f77b-477c-8af5-c8c2eb8c5353][jobsearch]]\n\n** pref\nwe haven’t made up any of the questions in this book.

But, they do not agree with each other.\n\nThis just adds to the anxiety and confusion: the domain of religion, too, seems\nto be chaotic and uncertain. Unless—we hope—we can find the one true path that\nreally does have the answers.\n#+end_quote\n\nI think I'm in this place of trying to find a certain set of answers or a path\nthat will get me a deeper more fufilling life. At least my meditation lately has\nmade me more aware of this. That's probably a good thing but feels shitty now.\n\n#+begin_quote\nBuddhism is unique, as far as I know, in insisting that the kind of answers we\nwant cannot be had, anywhere. Emptiness—inherent uncertainty—is at the heart of\nBuddhism.\n#+end_quote\n\nhttps://vividness.live/fit\n\n#+begin_quote\nI believe that all Buddhist sects are valid. However, they offer different\nteachings and practices, and have different styles or “flavors.” What matters is\nfinding one that offers what you need, as a unique individual, to move in the\ndirection you want to go.\n\nThis typically takes several years of exploration.\nIt involves finding out [numbering mine]:\n1. What style of teaching and practice do I find inspiring? What motivates me to practice?\n2. Where am I at, spiritually? What am I currently capable of? What are my strengths and weaknesses?\n3. What are the different directions I can go from here? Among those, which direction do I want to go?\n4. What tools are available to take me from where I am to where I want to go?\n5. Which Buddhist teachers and lineages offer those tools? Where do I feel a heart connection? What do I like?\n#+end_quote\n\n1. For reading, I like pragmatic, minimal BS, scientific stuff. \"if you do this,\n   you should experience this.\" Like a description of a science experiment. Not\n   magical stuff saying like \"the world is spacious involvement and pure energy\n   and is teetering between existence and non-existence.\"\n   For practice, this is also inspiring. I get excited to try the exact science\n   experiment and see if I can replicate and sometimes this expands my view of\n   things. Maybe it would help if I wrote essays or something to try to explain\n   what they're saying in terms of a science experiment.\n   Motivation to practice, I guess is what's above. I think there's a negative\n   aspect too. I often fall out of practicing. What got me back into it this\n   iteration is noticing how boring or constrained my life is becoming. Or,\n   thinking back to previous iterations, there's some fear of not living life to\n   the fullest. Maybe the current iteration is a specific example of that\n   generalization\n2. I'm at the point of feeling like there could be something more there. I've\n   done some meditating the past couple weeks that has shown a few things:\n   - Like weird changes in perception of space while meditating. Like that I'm\n     expanding or moving through space or size is changing. These are real,\n     perceptual things, that must be a real psychological phenomenon.\n   - There's also been a lot of the boring feeling of just sitting.\n   - Noticing a little bit of fear of losing grasp of reality. In such\n     situations the fear results in more thought to \"ground myself.\" I suspect\n     this might really be fear of nonexistence as they say in the books, which\n     means I might be getting somewhere\n   So I'm capable of sitting for like 30 minutes or more. I've gotten past the\n   boredom. But some insecurities sometimes grab me. For example, the fear of me\n   being a loser trying to escape reality. This makes me feel uncomfortable and\n   weird sometimes and stop meditation or reading about it.\n   Strength is that I'm past the boredom and I'm into fear. But I've not gone\n   further into that. I don't think I ever have. Weakness is the insecurity.\n   Lack of consistency too. And that I always fall out of it. Why do I fall out\n   of it? I guess fear that its just more referential thinking even while\n   meditating and I'm not going anywhere and maybe going backwards by just\n   trying harder thinking and meditating while sending myself the message that\n   life isn't good enough as it is.\n   Still need to figure out why I always quit.\n3. Possible directions:\n   a) Can continue with she-ne meditation and go into the fear more and see if\n      its really the fear of non-existence. Then there should be further I can\n      go from there into solidifying meditation and the thoughtless state.\n   b) But I think I lack a scientific understanding of what the expected result\n      is and what I hope to get out of it for (a). Maybe I could try to re-read\n      and write down the method in a scientific way.\n   c) Try something else. Try to find more pragmatic things that have already\n      been written.\n   d) Find out why I quit. Maybe this is lack of community or other practical\n      real world people thing. I could look more into Evolving Ground, read some\n      resources, join their dischord server, etc.\n   I think option (a) is the most appealing. I don't think I've put enough\n   discipline into it or have gone deep enough to really test the hypothesis.\n   But doing (b) for the stuff in [[id:e6a8909f-f2c9-4471-943d-3b7d84307061][spectrum of ecstacy]] and Roaring Silence would\n   be useful and motivating. I could also go on the Aro website to try to read\n   more practical instructions that may inform my scientific framing of the\n   thing.\n   I'm not like a \"meditate every day to feel good\" type person. I want effort\n   directed at a specific result. Maybe this is constraining or maybe can expand\n   the experiment to include and every day practice that achieves a result.\n4. Not sure where I want to go. I want more emotions and more passionate\n   feelings to bring more meaning to my life. This passionate feeling should\n   give more energy to be more disciplined in things and do more with my life.\n   I think part of what I want is a framing of my life in terms of improvemet.\n   But it seems like the answer provided here is that I'll never have that\n   security, but only some methods.\n   Tools? Maybe this experiencing thoughtlessness would get me somewhere and\n   make me aware of cognition from outside of it to at least do something about\n   it? Where I want to go is so vaguely defined. Thoughtlessness might also help\n   me experience emotions more.\n5. So the Aro people wrote those books I'm reading, Evolving Ground seems more\n   pracical and less culturally Tibetan that I think it'd be a better fit. They\n   definitely do the she-ne thing and are secular about it, scientific,\n   practical, and life affirming. I like the life-affirming Vajrayana stuff.\n" 536870913] [188 :nodes/created-time "20220801215146" 536870913] [188 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [188 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220801215146-vividness_david_chapman.org" 536870913] [188 :nodes/id "c9bfdc3c-2fbc-41f9-bb90-3f1af1165271" 536870913] [188 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [188 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [188 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [188 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [188 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220801215146-vividness_david_chapman", "ID" "c9bfdc3c-2fbc-41f9-bb90-3f1af1165271", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220801215146-vividness_david_chapman.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [188 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [188 :nodes/title "vividness david chapman" 536870913] [188 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [188 :nodes/value 2.0 536870913] [189 :links/dest "\"903253ec-c378-4afd-881c-195447e4e4cb\"" 536870913] [189 :links/pos 149 536870913] [189 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [189 :links/source "\"58795098-c56f-47ad-8fe9-4b70ecda3f7c\"" 536870913] [189 :links/type "\"id\"" 536870913] [189 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       58795098-c56f-47ad-8fe9-4b70ecda3f7c\n:END:\n#+title: the road to serfdom\n\n[[id:83a85a81-5256-4915-8758-10777d5dc1fb][hayek]] [[id:903253ec-c378-4afd-881c-195447e4e4cb][liberalism]]\n\nbook by Hayek\n\n** one: the abandoned road\n- people are take liberalism's success for granted and slowly propose ideas of central\n  planning to fix current and apparent problems we see in liberalism.

Good first\n;; steps are to copy this file to a file named by the language you are adding,\n;; and then use `query-replace' to replace all strings of \"template\" in this\n;; file with the name of your new language.\n\n;; After the `query-replace' step, it is recommended to load the file and\n;; register it to org-babel either via the customize menu, or by evaluating the\n;; line: (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(template . t)) where\n;; `template' should have been replaced by the name of the language you are\n;; implementing (note that this applies to all occurrences of 'template' in this\n;; file).\n\n;; After that continue by creating a simple code block that looks like e.g.\n;;\n;; #+begin_src template\n\n;; test\n\n;; #+end_src\n\n;; Finally you can use `edebug' to instrumentalize\n;; `org-babel-expand-body:template' and continue to evaluate the code block. You\n;; try to add header keywords and change the body of the code block and\n;; reevaluate the code block to observe how things get handled.\n\n;;\n;; If you have questions as to any of the portions of the file defined\n;; below please look to existing language support for guidance.\n;;\n;; If you are planning on adding a language to org-babel we would ask\n;; that if possible you fill out the FSF copyright assignment form\n;; available at https://orgmode.org/request-assign-future.txt as this\n;; will make it possible to include your language support in the core\n;; of Org-mode, otherwise unassigned language support files can still\n;; be included in the contrib/ directory of the Org-mode repository.\n\n\n;;; Requirements:\n\n;; Use this section to list the requirements of this language.

It has:\n\n#+begin_quote\nintestine of the fed rats was heavier and the deoxyribonucleic acid content\ngreater than in the fasted group and these increases appeared to be due to the\ngreater cell mass of the mucosal fraction.\n...\ncell content between the two groups is believed to be related to the stimulatory\neffect of food compared with the relative inhibitory effect of even a short\nperiod of starvation on cell proliferation in the epithelial crypts of the small\nintestine\n#+end_quote\n\nBut this post is mainly related to [[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F15548627.2021.1909406][How autophagy controls the intestinal epithelial barrier]].\n\nBasically autophagy helps endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ROS, helping the\nintestingal stem cells (ISCs) not prematurely differentiate or die. Basically\nsimilar stuff with goblet cells & immune cells producing anti-microbial pepties.\n\nTheory\n- IEC cells proliferate due to constant mTOR stimulation in fed state\n- ROS builds in damaged IEC cells\n- Fasting leads to large cell loss due to compounded autophagy signal of\n  fasting + ROS\n- Leaves you with a temporarily thin (& vulnerable!) intestinal epithelium. This\n  is why breaking a fast sucks.\n- As autophagy does its magic, cells slowly have less ROS, they live longer, and\n  you have a badass epithelium.\n- Breaking a fast should be easier if you have glycine and N-Acetyl Cysteine to\n  ease the ROS and trigger regrowth. Also starting with a small meal.\n  But wouldn't this imply that you're interfering autophagy?\n\n\nMixed signals on my thesis\n\nBut two references over to [[https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.20.1.195][Intestinal Transport During Fasting and Malnutrition]]\nsays \"significant decreases in mucosal mass are evident after fasts of 24 h or\nmore\".

Like someone trying\n  to figure out a mystery given strange and hard to connect clues. That would be\n  fun. All the more if its for a meaningful cause. I don't think I could do it in\n  an extremely political climate though. Like nutrition or some medical stuff.\n\n** 08-29\nI'm being pulled in so many different directions and I'm not sure how to spend\nmy time. Should I be looking into AI, reading about database modling, learning\nabout how to improve my nutrition/health, doing coding challenges to prep for\ninterviews, or what?\n\nThis overwhelm is starting to make me think that /nothing/ is good enough. And\nwhenever I am doing something, it's half-assed because my mind is partially\nwondering if I should instead be doing a million other things.\n\nThere's certainly some habit changes that need to happen. Maybe reading more of\nMeaningness would help? Or that one book that's like a productivity book but\nnot, saying you just need to decide for yourself and make and actual choice\nright now and commit to a path, thereby closing other possible life paths.  It\nis attractive to keep them all in your head because you feel like the\npossibilities are limitless. But then you're just not really defined. You end up\ndoing nothing meaningful.\n\nI think this is something I should form an opinion on?\n\nSide note: I'm glad I'm asking these questions in the first place. I know so\nmany people don't. I sense the \"offness\" of what is happening. This is some form\nof intellectual honesty, or being able to listen to thoughts and feelings over\nthe excitement and promises of the world. I think this is because of meditation.\nI've been having a hard time justifying meditation, but I think this is\nultimately it. You can never stray too far off track if you listen honestly to\nyourself.\n\n** 08-21\nI fear that I'm not as good as other people. I can't do what other people can.\n\nMaybe a startup could be a place where I could figure that out? Referring to [[id:03f07731-cc68-432c-9d16-9c2944f6a21c][yc]]\nvid about hiring, I'm not the awesome person they say you should try to hire.\n\nThat's not to say that I can't get there eventually. Maybe it's that I'm hoping\na startup helps develop me into greater potential. That's a perfectly legit\nmotivation in my opinion. This might be what Collison meant when he said you\ncould use personal development as an attraction point. He referenced the\nleverage aspect too. At Google you can't make much of a difference for the\ncompany as a whole. At a startup you can really see how much you're propelling\nthe boat. But maybe also the personal development thing.\n\nThe pinterest guy says you NEED people that die hard always cared about discovery.\nI think thats fucking dumb and unrealisty. In reality, the idea should be deeply\nexciting and hook into some core value that you have. Like joining replit would\nbe cool to destroy the laptop class which I resent.\n\n\nI think it's okay that I don't have an awsome\n\nSo why do I want to join a startup, ranked with importance.\n- Be engaged. I'd rather work more hours and be excited and care about something.\n  All the best times in my work are those times and it's the best.\n- Get great experience so I can grow into the most badass version of myself. i.e.\n  the one that would one day start a company one day.\n- To get rich\n\nBut I fear I need to get more meta than this. Why do I want all THIS in the first\nplace?! Are there ANY life goals that are above this?\n\nAm I 100% sure it's not for presteige? Genuinely, what would I do if I had a\nmillion dollars?\n\n** 08-16\nToday I finished my profile on Y combinator and applied to Replit.\n\nI could see myself getting back into engineering? I read some twitter blogs and\nit seems interesting. I like how they talk about career progression and take\nself-improvement so deadly seriously. For me it was like for what though?\nFor nerding out on Engineering itself?\n\nThe end feels important and idk the joy of coding for the sake of itself\nhas always been a struggle for me. Maybe it's because it really does need a\nmeaningful end other than just increasing understanding. There are some cases\nwhere you do need to test stuff and get something, but it needs a meaningful end\nthat I believe in.\n\nEkata felt like we were into engineering for the sake of itself. The wrok didn't\nfeel meaningful enough. Also, I wasn't even learning that much!\nIt was mainly extending and improving an old system.\n\nBUT I think engineering is still fun.\n\nLike getting back into a frontend+backend clojure project like radio station\nsounds pretty fun.\n\nAlso, creating something where I can export my org roam db as a full blown\nwebsite sounds pretty cool too.\n\nI think my own \"ambition\" is getting in the way. Like some of this reflection\nperiod has been accepting that I'm not going to start an awesome startup right\naway and be a millionare and be able to have all the freedom in the world. There\nare more steps along the way and they will give structure to my life.\n" 536870913] [196 :nodes/created-time "20220717092816" 536870913] [196 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [196 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220717092816-sabatical_2022.org" 536870913] [196 :nodes/id "82ed419e-60ed-4740-b670-87b433aa49c8" 536870913] [196 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [196 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [196 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [196 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [196 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20220717092816-sabatical_2022", "ID" "82ed419e-60ed-4740-b670-87b433aa49c8", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20220717092816-sabatical_2022.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [196 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [196 :nodes/title "sabbatical 2022" 536870913] [196 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [196 :nodes/value 2.5416666865348816 536870913] [197 :links/dest "\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7212476/\"" 536870913] [197 :links/pos 305 536870913] [197 :links/properties "(:outline (\"Metformin and Its Benefits for Various Diseases\"))" 536870913] [197 :links/source "\"9dba0048-02d0-4bde-9866-50ca4a6bf2ff\"" 536870913] [197 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [197 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       9dba0048-02d0-4bde-9866-50ca4a6bf2ff\n:END:\n#+title: metformin\n\nsome metformin research\n\n** Hypothesis: Metformin is a potential reproductive toxicant\nhttps://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.1000872\nfrom amber on twitter!\n\n** Metformin and Its Benefits for Various Diseases\n- a review: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7212476/\n  - overall function. also activates AMPK through other pathways\n    #+begin_quote\n    Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I (13, 14), which leads to AMPK (adenosine 5′- monophosphate—activated protein kinase) activation (15).

Scaffolding practices help you\nloosen the mental grip, so you can remain present and uninvolved at the same\ntime.\n#+end_quote\n\nSo intention to remain aware is a scaffold itself? For what function? To be able to\nremain present while being uninvolved? Does remaining uninvolved diminish awareness?\nBy what mechanism?\n\nAlso, it seems like when I first start I'm really lost. Might be nice to\nremember my goal of life vividness each time I sit.\n\nPost\nAware vs Uninvolved\n\nFrom what I understand, the intention to remain aware is a scaffold for OA / remaining uninvolved. But what is the goal of remaining aware for serving OA?\n\n- Practicing awareness first helps dissociate awareness from focus.\n- Awareness helps you notice your own involvement.\n- Remaining uninvolved normally causes awareness to withdraw for the uninitiated (by what mechanism?). So practicing awareness first helps prevent this from happening.\n- Remaining aware is part of and inseparable from remaining uninvolved. Practicing awareness first is a good gradual step to the whole practice.\n\nSo by remaining aware, you are also remaining uninvolved?\n- Is practicing the intent to remain aware in everyday life also contraindicated as the\n  intent to remain uninvolved is?\n\n\n*** 2023-08-25\n\nHard to meditate when I tried.

Is maintaining\n  awareness a form of involvement? And knowing you're aware seems like it requires a form\n  of involvement.\n  I think [[https://discord.com/channels/872184419723653190/1129140291841048666/1133814890839154708][this reply]] might be related. So maybe the \"remain uninvolved\" and\n  \"maintain awareness\" are the contrived aspects. But to what extent? Is \"maintain awareness\"\n  analagous to a scaffold in some sense?\n  What is the relationship between sitting with the intention to remain aware vs\n  the intention to remain uninvolved? Does one come before the other?\n\n*** 2023-08-24\n\nMeditation\n\nI felt like I was mostly lost in thought the entire time. But I don't think\nthat's bad. I'm just actually noticing it. The thoughts were like commentary\nabout the experience of meditating itself, interspersed with really getting off\ntrack, like thinking about what I should do after this or what theories I have\nabout meditation, or what to do with Marc when he visits.\n\nUsing the scaffold of focusing on the breath as like an anchor for awareness\nseems to help a lot.\n\nI noticed that where my focus / awareness seems to go is somewhat a form of\ninvolvement or my thoughts deliberately avoiding the experience. Before, I think\nI thought it was me myself directing the meditating experience & deliberately\nguiding it to help the experience. Regarding the flow of focus as another\nstimulus, as an object, was a breakthrough. Trying to maintain awareness in\nbreath helped with that realization.\n\nTheory so far\n\n- Conceptualization manipulates perception to make reality more agreeable.\n  This is constraining and gets to be less fun over time.\n  This happens unconsciously.\n- Claim made in [[id:e6a8909f-f2c9-4471-943d-3b7d84307061][spectrum of ecstacy]]: We do this to prove our own existence because we fear that we don't\n  exist. In fact, we have both existing and non existing qualities:\n  permanence/impermanence, solidity/insubstantiality,\n  separateness/inseparability, continuity/discontinuity,\n  definition/undefinability.\n  We tend to promote the first thing rather than the second. We have compulsion\n  to make good things feel permanant.\n- With meditation, you can exist separate from your conceptualization.\n  SoE: with she-ne, you get used to the thoughtless state.\n  Is this so you realize when you're /doing/ thinking rather than in happening\n  to you? why? So you can see more of it? See the insecure and unproductive\n  nature of it most of the time?\n  - relates to premise of dimension of awareness. This would expand awareness\n    particularly in conceptualization/thought. esp since this is what diminishes\n    awareness (is it?).\n- SoE says thoughtless experience expands the previous confines of your\n  self-definition\n\nrandom things\n- I notice when you realize the impermanence, things feel more meaningful. Its\n  hard to solidify this view in everyday action.\n  Do we exchange security for meaningfulness/vividness/depth?\n  - the link from impermanence->meaningfulness seems logical. I'm not sure about\n    the others. For the first one, I'm not sure how logical it actually is?\n    maybe its foundation is really experiential, but it's just easier to grasp\n    than the others. So maybe experience in the others would help.\n- Successful people seem to be less defined by insecure motives & less\n  constrained in thought patterns.\n- Premise of the dimension of awareness. That you can either be more or less\n  aware of what is happening and you probably want to be more aware.\n- If you can control your thoughts (& therefore feelings), you can do anything.\n  People respond to vibes. If you can give yourself the right vibe in any\n  situation, you can go anywhere.\n\n*** 2023-08-23\n\nReading opening awareness [[https://www.evolvingground.org/opening-awareness/10][here]] under \"Expanding sensory awareness\" & I think\nthere's something to the compression aspect of conceptualization. There's so\nmuch sensory input that we need to automatically conceptualize to make sense of\nit all.\n\nLike maybe instead of magic, there's an evolutionary reason to allow us to get\naround that compression.\n\nI heard meditation can make the brain use more energy? Maybe this is like training\nyour brain like an athlete to tap into a state where you're using more energy so\nyou can process more stimuli.\n\n\nMeditated at night past 12. Was okay.

A long time ago I thought one\nof the big premises was that there was a difference in the quality of your\nexperience.

I've been noticing more that my\nlife is a bit bland and boring. I guess I've been drawn to some of David\nChapman's stuff, and his wife, which got me into Spectrum of Ecstacy, which kind\nof explicitly addressed the narrative of repressing emotions to remain in contol\nand think too much but kills all the vibrancy out of life.\n\nI think experiencially, I've noticed this. I've cried sever times to music in\nthe past couple weeks after not doing that for years. Also, I kinda see the\ntruth in knowing that when I sit to meditate, there's this strange compulsive\nthinking that's happening that makes me want to look further. I do not see this\ncompulsion as being fueled by the fear of not existing like they claim in\nSpectrum of Ecstacy yet, but I wouldn't preclude it. There is definitely the\nfear there that I'll lose touch with reality or go insane and not be able to\nfunction in the real world if I go into the gap between thoughts more deeply. I\ndon't know if this is tied to existing or relates to existing under the surface.\n\nHonestly, kinda worried something bad is happening. Like I'm hitting some wall\nagain. Maybe its just circumstances and like my health hasn't been awesome so\nthat's always a distraction.\n\n** Spectrum of Ecstacy\n[[id:e6a8909f-f2c9-4471-943d-3b7d84307061][spectrum of ecstacy]]\n\nRainbow of ...\n\"Shi-né is the method of getting used to emptiness.\"\n\n\"we realise that it is actually the /sparkling through/ of our beginningless\nenlightenment that prompts us to practise.\"\n\nView, Meditation and Action\n\n\"From the ultimate perspective, meditation is not a fabricated state that needs to be artificially maintained; it is our /natural state/ and as such only needs to be /discovered/.\"\n\n_Discovering Space_\n\n\"Shi-né means 'remaining uninvolved'.\"\n\n\"Expect nothing.

So you don't\n  even need enlightenment.\n- it's a matter of getting used to existence\n  - like how Chapman says to get used to nebulosity.\n  - and Roarning Silence says mediation is getting used to the enlightened state\n    I guess that means just not impulsively running from it.\n- don't let anything bother you -- suzuki\n- let go and let be. Keep letting go and letting be. -- Roaring Silence\n  - i.e. remain uninvolved\n- just accept things as they are\n- you have the thought in you're head that youre not supposed to think which\n  reminds you to let go of thoughts.\n- it doesn't actually require effort. you notice the \"effort\" as another thought\n  and objectify it as not part of \"you\". The hard part is to choose to do this.\n- experiencing this moment is always THE most important thing. It's the only way\n  you can grow and learn.\n" 536870913] [198 :nodes/created-time "20220817162354" 536870913] [198 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [198 :nodes/file

It is the eschewing\nof the burden of having a self. It is equivalent to self-hypnosis. Basically,\nthese people all say that budhism is what you do if you want to cease to exist\nand don't want to have to deal with the pain of having a will and not being able\nto impose it on the world. So you self-hypnotize into a state of bliss.\n\nHowever, they all believe in the reality of self-deception being pervasive. They\nsay that self-deception is another way to ignore reality and the pain of reality\nnot reflecting your own ideals. They also say that self-deception is sneaky.\nIt's something that often you yourself are not aware of when you do it. This is\ntrue almost by definition.\n\nI'm not aware if they've mentioned anything about exactly /how/ to avoid\nself-deception. It seems they think that if you're strong enough, or you\nself-analyze critically enough, or you're honest enough that you won't fall into\nself deception. This sounds dangerously close to being a recursive argument. It\nis a recursive argument.\n\nBudhism takes an aggressive stance on self-deception. We lie to ourselves so\nmuch and so pervasivly that we usually don't see a true version of reality.\nSomething slightly painful can be so easily filtered out of consciousness by the\nsubconscious. This comfort seeking becomes ingrained in us. Instead of true\nreality, we see our ego imposed on reality.\n\nThere's somewhat of a mismatch of definitions of the word ego. For budhists,\nit's this comfort-seeking, self-referential part of us. It's the view we have of\nour selves and our place in the world. The ego is only our /perception/ of our\nself, not our actual self. For Ayn Rand and friends, our ego /is/ our self. So\nwhen budhists say \"destroy the ego\", they think it means to destroy your self so\nyou don't have to deal with the pain of existence i.e. the pain coming from\nthe difference between our ideal and reality.\n\nOur perception of our self is a subset of our actual self, though. For instance,\nthere's interests, people you love, ideals you admire, and changes you want to\nsee in the world. These parts of our selves are actually served much better in\nthe absence of a self-image.\n\nHow we think about ourselves and our standing in the world mainly gets in the\nway of the other stuff. We seek prestiege instead of passion, get stuck in the\nrat race, and forget about the ones we love. Our self image is one of the big\nreasons we are so comfort-seeking. One of the main reasons we ignore reality and\ndistract ourselves from the pain of existence. (why?)\n\nZen budhism in the secular sense (filtering out mystical bullshit), is about\ngetting rid of this so we can accept reality and be more of our self. Meditation\nis about \"letting be\" and seeing where the thoughts go. When you let things go\nwithout getting sucked up in the thought, you no longer get distracted from the\npain. You filter out less of reality.\n\nWow i realized I don't really know anything about this topic! just a start\n- why does self-image especially make us exculude reality?\n  - you tell youself \"I am this.\" (lovable, likeable, cool, smart, etc) and you're proud\n    and you ignore stuff that may be the contrary?\n    Or you fake to yourself and others so those attributes seem true.\n    - you try to prop up this image of yourself and alter perception of reality\n      until it your self-image fits into what satisfies you\n- really ego (self-perception) is just part of zen, not the whole story\n  - theoretically there's other pain points that filter reality\n\n\nRewrite 1\n\nAyn Rand, Nietzsche, Paul Graham, and others say that budhism is equivalent to\nself-hypnosis. It's what you do if the pain of having a will and not being able\nto impose it on the world is too much so you just want to bliss out and throw\naway your will.\n\nBut really I think this is just a misunderstanding. For Budhism, \"ego\" is your\nself-image. It's the view we have of our self and our place in the world. It is\nonly our /perception/ of our self, not our actual self.\n\nOur perception of our self is a subset of our actual self, though. For instance,\nthere's your interests, people you love, ideals you admire, and changes you want\nto see in the world. These parts of our selves are actually served better in the\nabsence of a self-image.\n\nSelf-image mainly gets in the way of the other stuff. We seek prestiege instead\nof passion, get stuck in the rat race, and forget about the ones we love. Our\nself image is one of the main reasons we are so comfort-seeking. It's why we\nignore reality and distract ourselves from the pain of existence.\n\nYou tell yourself \"I am this.\" (lovable, likeable, cool, smart, etc.), and\nyou're proud proud of that. It lets you rest assured. You prop up this image of\nyou and alter perception of reality until your perception matches the\nself-image you've created.\n\nOne thing Paul Graham and Ayn Rand and friends aggree about is that self-deception\nis /sneaky/. You can't really fully trust your own motives. You have to always be\nquestioning them. Except for the heroes. They are naturally strong enough to face reality\nhead on and have no shaking of faith because they've always done it for the right reasons\nall along.\n" 536870913] [206 :nodes/created-time

(depending on how well this goes)\n  - maybe this would be better bc OpenLLaMA 3B is pretty weak. Might be more exciting to work on something that could be more impactful.\n    But having the ideas work on 3B could be impactful?\n\ndetails:\n- *replicate LongLLaMA with 3B llama model*\n  - [ ] replicate eval tests with their parameters (gh [[https://github.com/CStanKonrad/long_llama/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#longllama-performance][link]])\n    - passkey retrieval seems easy enough as it's in a notebook [[https://github.com/CStanKonrad/long_llama/blob/main/long_llama_colab.ipynb][here]].\n    - can copy the [[https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness][lm-evaluation-harness]] stuff.\n      Seems actually pretty useful to figure this out and evaluate changes and stuff I do along the way.\n  - [ ] understand training procedure exactly\n\n*** training notes\n\n- questions\n  - do they do any other training besides the cross-batch thing?\n    - I don't think so.\n\n- training procedure\n  - it looks like the their training [[https://huggingface.co/syzymon/long_llama_3b_v1_1/blob/main/config.json][config]] matches the openlm-research [[https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_3b_v2/blob/main/config.json#L1][config]] very closely, so I can probably assume the training is almost the same especially given the similarity of code.\n  - 10B tokens for 3B model, but only 3B for 7B model?, from appendix A.3 -- data based on [[https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data][RedPajama]] and The Stack (arXiv:2211.15533v1). Procedure of sampling is discussed there.\n\n\n*** theories (of improvement)\n- It is suboptimal to take the embedding directly from the transformer itself bc you (might be) conflating the problem of encoding a good vector space memory with the logic of attending to weights in existing model.

RDA\nis measured by /nitrogen balance/. Protein is titrated down till there starts\nbeing net nitrogen loss. However, he suggests there may be benefits in repair,\nmuscle growth, thermogenesis, etc. But it seems like mostly this is replacing\ncarbs w/ protein.\n\nthere are anabolic and metabolic benefits to consuming 20-30g protein per meal.\ne.g. stimulation of mTOR for muscle protein synthesis.\n\n#+begin_quote\nResistance exercise appears to increase the efficiency of EAA use for muscle\nanabolism and to lower the meal threshold for stimulation of protein synthesis.\n#+end_quote\n\nConcentration of amino acids determines the response. The extent of the response\nis determined by the specific amino acid bottleneck. So if one is low then you\ndon't get the response. Animal protein is the right balance ofc.\n\n#+begin_quote\nThus, dietary guidelines based solely on the efficiency of amino acid use for\ngrowth or nitrogen balance outcomes may be neglecting the fact that changes in\nintracellular amino acid concentrations and oxidative catabolism are an\nimportant means to regulate and support many normal metabolic responses beyond\nthe synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds.\n#+end_quote\n\ni.e. there could be additional benefits for protein besides just the restoration\nof nitrogen-containing compounds. Hence RDA could underestimate.\n\nLiver has minimal capacity to break down BCAA's. Supposedly so plasma levels\nrise so peripheral tissues get a chanse to use them.\n\nBCAA's (esp. leucine) stimulate protein synthesis.\n\n#+begin_quote\n1) the amount of dietary protein at a meal required to initiate an anabolic\n   response in skeletal muscle is driven by the leucine content;\n2) there is little anabolic benefit in skeletal muscle with protein meals larger\n   than the minimum amount required for maximum mTORC1 signaling and activation\n   of mRNA translation initiation;\n3) the intracellular leucine concentration necessary to trigger muscle protein\n   synthesis also increases BCAA oxidation; and\n4) aging produces “anabolic resistance” requiring increased EAAs to achieve\n   maximum mTORC1 signaling and muscle protein synthesis.\n\nThese points lead us to propose that the distribution of protein at individual\nmeals is physiologically important to optimize mTORC1 signaling and muscle\nprotein synthesis. This concept is termed the “meal threshold.”\n#+end_quote\n\nExact leucine threshold to trigger mTORC1 hasn't been studied in humans\n\nmTORC1 does not determine duration of protein synthesis. mTORC1 is activated\nwithin 30 min after meal, w/ maximum protein synthesis at 60-90 min.  The rate\nof protein synthesis declines between 2–3 h postmeal, although mTORC1 signals\nremain activated and plasma leucine concentrations remain elevated.  The\nduration of synthesis cannot be extended even with continuous infusion of more\namino acids.\n- there is a \"refractory period\". So they think protein needs time to reset\n  before another meal can stimulate synthesis.\n\n\"Protein-containing meals that stimulate mTORC1 also activate the BCAA catabolic\npathway.\" Thus muscle growth inherently requires wasted nitrogen! Another reason\nRDA is an under estimate.\n- side note: I wonder if ketosis changes this. maybe should read some [[id:c96bbc45-f182-4fe7-8bee-e876dc694b2c][ben bikman]] work\n\nOlder people get \"anabolic resistence\" -- so they don't get as much anabolic\nstimulation from the same amount of exercise / amino acid intake.\n\n#+begin_quote\nThese findings led to dietary recommendations for older adults that emphasize a\nmeal threshold of >20 g protein containing >2.2 g leucine to optimize that\nanabolic response in skeletal muscle\n#+end_quote\n\nSo likely since I'm young, I probably don't even need 20g to \"optimize that anabolic response\".\n\n#+begin_quote\nAcknowledging inherent risks for comparing dietary treatments across studies,\nthe optimum meal threshold for older sedentary adults appears to be >25 g\nprotein, whereas healthy, young, active men respond to meals with 15 g\nprotein\n#+end_quote\n\n!!

Or could small intestinal microbes be playing a big role there? In which case, would the high fat intervention make sense?\n\nFor the endotoxin released via chylomicrons when consuming fat, the source of the LPS must be small intestinal bacteria, right? So there's at some bacteria there.

Really, metformin doesn't block complex I\n- (4) metformin promotes fat oxidation during fasting but promotes glucose\n  oxidation during the first three hours after a plate of \"cookies\"\n- (5) reason for 4 is that mtG3Pdh blockade causes less glucose-induced\n  superoxide which prevents the minimum superoxide required for insulin\n  signalling. Then in the fed state, it causes less insulin /resistance/ bc less\n  superoxide. This fed state will cause more lactate production bc more glucose\n  is entering cells when theyre already oxidized.\n- (6) physiological insulin is secreted from pancreas, w/ HIGH concentration in\n  the pancreas, which turns off glucagon, then it goes through portal vein to\n  liver at HIGH concentration to tell it to suck up glucose instead of releasing\n  it, THEN it gets to peripheral cells to tell them to suck up some glucose.\n  Injected insulin will never look like this. The only solution is keto.\n- (10) metformin increases ffa's while fasting\n\n* protons\n- fadh2:nadh+ ratio is 0.48 for palmitate, and 0.2 for glucose\n- lower ratio => reverse electrons through complex I => superoxide\n- superoxide (O2--, for which h2o2 is a good proxy) causes insulin resistance\n- (5) fasting causes superoxide / insulin resistence which is needed for survival\n  or else the brain would starve (it's dependent on glucose)\n- (6) metformin slows complex I, increasing superoxide, making fat resist insulin\n  and therefore burn fat!\n- neurons run on lactate! They can't even affort the superoxide from glucose, so\n  the glial cells feed them lactate!\n- (13) zero fat-- the carbosis phenomenon!\n  - in a pancreas, the same stuff happens w/ superoxide signalling, but instead\n    of causing insulin resistence, it causes insulin secretion\n  - you need some fat to create superoxide & secrete insulin. if blood ffa is\n    very low (from 0 fat diet & insulin preventing lipolysis), you won't get a\n    big insulin bump and then resting insulin will be very low. And you'll have\n    huge lipolysis\n- (14) superoxide causes mitochondrial biogenesis. there's nothing to cause\n  superoxide in neurons, except ketones! can maybe do so\n- (16) low F:N ratio => hypoglycemia !\n  bc even in muscle, low F:N causes\n\n* gluten\n- wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binds directly to intestinal cells, causing damage.

Other people have had these theories, but I'm\nvery happy someone close to the mainstream is advocating for the metabolic\nconnection to mental health.\n\nMost mental disorders likely have the same underlying cause. This is\nmitochondrial dysfunction. This creates a cellular energy deficit, which causes\nhyper-activated and under-activated neurons (it takes energy to both activate\nand deactivate neurons). Also some neurons release transmitters to specifically\ninhibit certain pathways. When these run out of energy, they can't do that,\nwhich leads to over-activation of those pathways. Protein synthesis, folding,\nclearance, and reuse can start having issues. Hence buildup of beta amyloid\nproteins in Alzheimers people. Certain enzymes are designed to breakdown\nneurotransmitters, so when these malfunction, you also get hyper-excitability.\n\nNeurons can just die from lack of energy, and this can happen in a systematic\nway and lead to developmental disorders like Autism.\n\nReduced cellular ATP has been found in many disorders.\n\nInsulin and thyroid hormone signal mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nInflammation directly impacts mitochondrial function which is my there's a link\nthere.\n\nDoesn't address the source of these inflammatory conditions and just says that\nthey can cause mental disorders. I think most people know this, but the big\nquestion is figuring out how to fix. I don't like that he pretending that\ninflammatory/autoimmune disorders are a solved problem. I get you're keeping\nyour book focussed on one topic, but don't pretend.\n\nBright lights increase ATP production, change calcium levels, have\nanti-inflammatory effects. Thought to improve mitochondria!\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-017-0852-4\n\nThinks fiber is the best thing ever and the only way to produce butyrate in the\ngut which is just plain false.\n\nThinks ketogenic diet is \"fasting mimicking\". I think it's more like fasting\nmimicks the ketogenic diet.\n\nUCP2 in the brain actually causes hypothalymus issues and weight gain!\n\n[[id:9dba0048-02d0-4bde-9866-50ca4a6bf2ff][metformin]] blocks aerobic excercise induced benefits to muscle mitochondria function!\n\nExercise induces mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. NOT ONLY in muscle\ncells, but also in brain cells! But it doesn't help so much if you have other\nissues going on, like inflammation. That's why RCT's don't always show a benefit.\nMost people have other shit going on.\n\n\n** interesting stats\n\n20% ppl in USA are diagnosed w/ mental or substance use disorder.\n\nRates are increasing a lot. Depression for children (12-17) increased 68% from 2006-2017. 18-25 its 49%.\n\nIn 2016 45k ppl died by suicide in USA. In general, for every death, 30 others\nattempt suicide, so 1 million per year attempt suicide.\n\n8.4% of USA adults had at least one depressive episode. 66% received treatment.\n\nStudy followed 431 ppl, assessed depressive symptoms weekly for 12 years. Even\nw/ treatment, 90% had persistent symptoms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.55.8.694\n\nLots but not all have elevated inflammatory markers.\n\nLater said, likelihood of full and complete remission of major depression\nsymptoms with first antidepressant is abotu 30-40%. Which seems pretty good imo\ncompared to that 90% mentioned above!\n\nAbout half of people diagnosed with any mental disorder have more than one.\n\nThere are 10-50 gial cells /per neuron/ in the brain\n\nPregnant woman with infections are 80% more likely to have a child w/ Autism.\nAnimal models of autism cause it by injecting inflammatory molecules into the\npregnant mother.\n" 536870913] [227 :nodes/created-time "20221118104537" 536870913] [227 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [227 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221118104537-brain_energy_by_palmer.org" 536870913] [227 :nodes/id "3cb405e2-2764-44ae-9b5e-42b842d4abd1" 536870913] [227 :nodes/level 0 536870913] [227 :nodes/olp "" 536870913] [227 :nodes/pos 1 536870913] [227 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [227 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20221118104537-brain_energy_by_palmer", "ID" "3cb405e2-2764-44ae-9b5e-42b842d4abd1", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20221118104537-brain_energy_by_palmer.org", "PRIORITY" "B"} 536870913] [227 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [227 :nodes/title "brain energy by palmer" 536870913] [227 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [227 :nodes/value 2.7479166984558105 536870913] [228 :links/dest "" 536870913] [228 :links/pos "" 536870913] [228 :links/properties "" 536870913] [228 :links/source "" 536870913] [228 :links/type "" 536870913] [228 :nodes/created-time "20231217202058" 536870913] [228 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [228 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org" 536870913] [228 :nodes/id "a46ace4f-7454-4ad2-9715-12d4aef9208d" 536870913] [228 :nodes/level 2 536870913] [228 :nodes/olp "(\"ai topics\")" 536870913] [228 :nodes/pos 310 536870913] [228 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [228 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20231217202058-ai_papers", "SUBNODE_OF" "776af6d0-9413-4156-b3e4-c5567e7e6b9c", "ID" "a46ace4f-7454-4ad2-9715-12d4aef9208d", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org", "PRIORITY" "B", "ITEM" "Data Augmentation"} 536870913] [228 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [228 :nodes/title "Data Augmentation" 536870913] [228 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [228 :nodes/value 6.4576755464077 536870913] [229 :links/dest "\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCz4OMemCcA\"" 536870913] [229 :links/pos 32517 536870913] [229 :links/properties "(:outline (\"papers\" \"Attention Is All You Need Vaswani\" \"Transformer explained\"))" 536870913] [229 :links/source "\"069ed005-71c4-4d67-8b2a-65d38e7837ca\"" 536870913] [229 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [229 :nodes/created-time "20231217202058" 536870913] [229 :nodes/deadline "" 536870913] [229 :nodes/file "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org" 536870913] [229 :nodes/id "069ed005-71c4-4d67-8b2a-65d38e7837ca" 536870913] [229 :nodes/level 2 536870913] [229 :nodes/olp "(\"papers\")" 536870913] [229 :nodes/pos 26905 536870913] [229 :nodes/priority "" 536870913] [229 :nodes/properties {"CATEGORY" "20231217202058-ai_papers", "ROAM_ALIASES" "Transformer", "SUBNODE_OF" "312af36b-506b-4914-bf21-902ae56d71c3", "ID" "069ed005-71c4-4d67-8b2a-65d38e7837ca", "BLOCKED" "", "FILE" "/Users/kevinkrausse/Documents/worknotes/org-roam/20231217202058-ai_papers.org", "PRIORITY" "B", "ITEM" "Attention Is All You Need Vaswani"} 536870913] [229 :nodes/scheduled "" 536870913] [229 :nodes/title "Attention Is All You Need Vaswani" 536870913] [229 :nodes/todo "" 536870913] [229 :nodes/value 3.1453773379325867 536870913] [230 :links/dest "\"//meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism\"" 536870913] [230 :links/pos 345 536870913] [230 :links/properties "(:outline nil)" 536870913] [230 :links/source "\"1635f9ee-30c7-48a5-8282-74fb1e9cc566\"" 536870913] [230 :links/type "\"https\"" 536870913] [230 :nodes/content ":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       1635f9ee-30c7-48a5-8282-74fb1e9cc566\n:END:\n#+title: meaningness david chapman\n\n[[id:876a8e7d-8daf-4e9a-9f05-30eb0ea81061][books]] [[id:eb039932-abd7-4a9b-89c9-d4f6e9d4adb1][budhism]] [[id:1eca4241-9815-471f-900c-d8864678ba9f][david chapman]]\n\nalso, vividness seems very interesting! https://vividness.live/thought-soup\n\nhttps://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism\n\ncool philisophical book maybe\n\nyes. cool.
