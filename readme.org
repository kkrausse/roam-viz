project to transform local org-roam database into a nice website

** impl
- how to handle data?
  - make just plain edn file w/ all the node and link data
    - it's pretty simple, so probably datascript isn't required.
  - make datascript db in one batch, give to UI.
    - then can mess with database and not have to worry about UI
    - separate resource for this?
      - then the UI can completely be a template and there is no
    - have macro build the db as an update
      - easier initially. updates require a recompile. That's annoying.

** todo
- [ ] noticed that "sibo" node didn't show in graph.
  Are nodes w/ no links being evicted?
- [ ] see https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/v3.0.0/README.md#forceSimulation
  to simulate collision? (like an imaginary ring surrounding the circles)
- [ ] parse org files into posts. Router for posts.
